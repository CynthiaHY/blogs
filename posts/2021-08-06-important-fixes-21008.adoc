== A new home for OpenJ9 Java Builds
 
For those of you currently running Open Liberty on AdoptOpenJDK builds of link:https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[OpenJ9], things are changing. From now on, OpenJ9 based Java builds will be built and hosted directly by IBM. The IBM Semeru Runtimes are free production-ready open source binaries built with the OpenJDK class libraries and the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM.  It’s the same high performant, lightweight JVM, same class libraries, and same license you’re used to, but with a cool new name.

== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A21.0.0.8+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 21.0.0.8].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/17904[grpcClient-1.0 dynamic enablement unexpected behavior]
+
Previously, the `grpcClient-1.0` feature could not be enabled dynamically after server startup. This was caused by an implementation bug - a mismatch between the `ServiceLoader` and `OSGi` lifecycles. The feature has been updated to remove its `ServiceLoader` reliance, allowing it to function correctly when it's enabled after server start.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/17799[gRPC monitoring requires the enablement of both grpc-1.0 and grpcClient-1.0]
+
Previously, when `monitoring-1.0` was enabled along with either of `grpc-1.0` or `grpcClient-1.0`, a bundle resolution error was encountered. There was no issue if both `grpc-1.0` and `grpcClient-1.0` were enabled. This happened because the gRPC monitoring private feature had simultaneous dependencies on both `grpc-1.0` and `grpcClient-1.0`. This issue was resolved by splitting up the internal gRPC monitoring implementation so that it can be used with the gRPC features independently.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/17828[Update JSP Logic to Avoid Race Condition Regarding trackDependencies]
+
A bug was discovered with the `trackDependencies` property in `JSP` when handling concurrent requests. This meant that dependents were not tracked, and the `JSP` would fail to update when any changes were made to these dependents. This issue was resolved by fixing a race condition regarding one of `JSP`'s variables.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/17757[Passivating remote EJB Stub fails when rmicCompatible=true]
+
When the `com.ibm.websphere.ejbcontainer.rmicCompatible` JVM property is set, a `ClassCastException` occurs when passivating then activating a stateful session bean that contains a reference (stub) to an `EJB 3.x` style remote interface that does not extend `java.rmi.Remote`. The issue has been fixed by using the `ORB` during passivation to convert the `stub` to a serialized string that my be restored during activation.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/17678[Port MYFACES-4065/MYFACES-4187 to JSF 2.2]
+
Occasionally, in `jsf-2.2` - `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` would be thrown if JSF tried to handle an empty string as a resource.  This would result in a error like below:

[source, java]
----
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0
at java.lang.String.charAt(Unknown Source)
at org.apache.myfaces.application.ResourceHandlerImpl.createResource(ResourceHandlerImpl.java:118)
at javax.faces.application.ResourceHandlerWrapper.createResource(ResourceHandlerWrapper.java:47)
----
Now a `NullPointerExcepton` will be thrown if a resourceName is `null`.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/17313[ubuntu upgrade re-enabled openliberty@defaultServer]
+
When upgrading `ubuntu` from `21.0.0.1-1ubuntu1` to `21.0.0.5-1ubuntu1`, `openliberty@defaultServer` was unexpectedly re-enabled, however the expected behaviour is that it should remain disabled. This issue was resolved by making sure the `defaultServer` service was only enabled if no `openliberty@` services exist, and to not enable the service if it already exists.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/16994[Dynamic reconfig of discovery endpoint not updating endpoints in all cases]
+
Previously, if a Social client was reconfigured, replacing the valid `discoveryEndpointUrl` with an empty string, and then reconfiguring it again with a good discovery endpoint, the endpoint would not be updated and users would receive a `403 error` in the response when they attempt to access a social login protected app. This issue was resolved by ensuring that the discoveryEndpointUrl and discoverey endpoints are properly dynamically updated.
