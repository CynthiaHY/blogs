[#Intro]
== Open Liberty Starter

There is now another easy way to get started using Open Liberty. Visit the link:{url-prefix}/downloads/[Getting Started] page and select a few options to generate a starter application using Open Liberty. You can specify your application and project name, choose a build tool from either Maven or Gradle, and pick which version of Java SE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile your application will use. Then, just click `Generate Project` and you are ready for lift-off! 

Once you download the starter project, unpackage the .zip file on your machine.

If you selected `Maven` as your build tool, then navigate to the installation directory and run `mvn liberty:run`. This will install all required dependencies and start the default server. 

If you selected `Gradle` as your build tool, then navigate to the installation directory and run `./gradlew libertyStart` to start the default server. 

For more information on developing your application in dev mode using either Maven or Gradle, see the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode documentation].

For further help on getting started actually developing your application, see some of our link:{url-prefix}/guides/?search=microprofile&key=tag[Microprofile guides] and link:{url-prefix}/guides/?search=jakarta%20ee&key=tag[Jakarta EE guides].

== Other ways to start using Open Liberty

There are a few other ways to get started with Open Liberty if you prefer instead:

[#Docker]
=== Docker image

You can pull in the official Open Liberty docker image from link:https://hub.docker.com/_/open-liberty[Docker Hub] and build your application image on top of the Open Liberty image. There is a guide on using Docker with Open Liberty link:{url-prefix}/guides/containerize.html[here].

=== Maven and Gradle
You can also use Maven or Gradle to pull in Open Liberty as a dependency for your application. 

==== Maven

To get started using Open Liberty with Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`, while specifying the version of Open Liberty that you want to use:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.openliberty</groupId>
    <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
    <version>[21.0.0.8,)</version>
    <type>zip</type>
</dependency>

==== Gradle

To get started using Open Liberty with Gradle, add the following to `build.gradle`, while specifying the version of Open Liberty that you want to use:

----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[21.0.0.8,)'
}
----

For more information on using Open Liberty and Gradle, visit our link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle Intro Guide].

=== Open Liberty Binary

Download an Open Liberty release from our link:Getting Started[{url-prefix}/downloads/#runtime_releases_table_container] page and extract the package. Then navigate to the `bin` directory and execute `./server create <server_name>` to create an Open Liberty server, or run `./server start` to automatically create and start a `defaultServer`. Then, you can add in your application to the dropins directory, or add the path to your application in the newly created `<path_to_Open_Liberty_install>/servers/<server_name>/server.xml`.
