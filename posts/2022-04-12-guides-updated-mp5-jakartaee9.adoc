//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

To learn how to develop microservices on Open Liberty with MicroProfile 5.0 and Jakarta EE 9.1, you can try out our updated guides. Excitingly, you can run our guides in a hosted environment with enhanced interfaces, without having to worry about local setup and prerequisites. We recently updated 31 of our guides for compatibility with MicroProfile 5.0 and Jakarta EE 9. The Maven project `pom.xml` and Liberty configuration `server.xml` files in these guides are updated to use new Jakarta EE 9.1 and MicroProfile 5.0 features. Also, all Java classes now use the `jakarta` package namespace instead of `javax`, as shown in the following example.

To learn more about what changed in Jakarta EE 9.1, see the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/jakarta-ee9-feature-updates.html[Jakarta EE 9.1 feature updates^] documentation. To learn about the differences between MicroProfile 5.0 and 4.1, see the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/mp-41-50-diff.html[Differences between MicroProfile 5.0 and 4.1^] documentation.


== What are the new enhancements in the cloud-hosted guides?

The cloud-hosted guides are enhanced with a new look and updated features. Whether or not you've tried them yet, now is the time to experience how simply you can learn the MicroProfile and Jakarta EE features with our newly enhancemed cloud-hosted guides. 

You can access any cloud hosted guide by clicking one of the links at the end of this blog or by selecting one from link:{url-prefix}/guides/[our full collection of guides]. After you choose a guide, click the *Run in cloud* button, as shown in the following image:

Instead of copying the commands and pasting them on terminal, now, you can run the commands on an active terminal by simply clicking on the Execute `>_` icon.

You can directly open file by clicking the *Open ... in IDE* button, instead of browsing file from the *File* > *Open* menu.
