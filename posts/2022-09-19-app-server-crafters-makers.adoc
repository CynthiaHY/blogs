Five years ago today, IBM published the source code of Liberty, it's little runtime that could, on GitHub: in 2017, the open source project, Open Liberty, was born. Liberty itself was actually born five years earlier, in 2012, to address the need for a small footprint, extensible, and easily configurable Java app server that could run on the cloud as well as in a data centre. Liberty was designed to provide link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/why-cloud-native-java-developers-love-liberty/[a friendly experience to developers] as well as to be powerful and flexible at runtime.


CHANGE TO SAY RUNTIME THROUGHOUT

== SUB-HEAD HERE

At the time, Java runtimes were mostly big and serious, but Liberty was different and Liberty's development team were inspired to make it fun. Even before its first release, Simon Maple (Liberty's first developer advocate) had link:https://youtu.be/cBV4tgLgDwg[run Liberty on the Raspberry Pi], which, in its recently released first incarnation, had just link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi[700 Mhz of processing power and 256 MB of memory]. He went on to demonstrate Liberty's applicability to the early Internet of Things by link:https://youtu.be/rH_SmgmyVUo[running Liberty and MQTT on a Raspberry Pi to remotely control a smart house 50 miles away].

Running Liberty on a Raspberry Pi and other hardware with limited resources sparked the imaginations of the makers within the development team.

== Early Liberty conference demos of Java EE on Liberty

One much-travelled Liberty conference demo was the link:https://github.com/WASdev/skunkworks.libertycar[remote-controlled Liberty Car], the creation of Simon's successor, Tom Banks. Tom replaced the guts of a remote-controlled car with a Raspberry Pi running Liberty plus a wifi access point:

Any conference attendee could connect and control the car from their own smartphone, demonstrating, among other things, the responsiveness of link:https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/06/ee7-websocket-support/[2013's Java EE 7 WebSocket technology]. Java EE, not then known for its small, lightweight footprint, easily ran on the limited hardware resources. Tom's Liberty Car project matured into a conference game where attendees could race multiple Liberty Cars around a large race-track. Tom talks through how it works:

== Loading and unloading Java EE features on the fly

Liberty could run with only a tiny footprint, making it friendly to both developer laptops and the cloud. This was enabled by its OSGi architecture which meant that any app running on Liberty could start with just minimal capabilities and then add and remove features dynamically at runtime as needed by the app.

=== Wearable application server (2013)

link:https://hollycummins.com/about/[Hollie Cummins], queen of the unconventional conference demos, came up with the idea of _wearing_ a Java application server as a hat. She sewed a Raspberry Pi into a chef's hat and installed Liberty on it. She then wore it in conferences presentations to show that a Java application server doesn't need to be big to be capable:

Of course, debugging a hat is best done whilst wearing it:

=== Cuddly throwable application server (2015)

== Open Liberty maker projects: Microservices

After the birth of Open Liberty, its bright space-related branding lent itself well to pretty visuals and space-themed games. Another important shift in the projects since the Open Liberty release was the move from demo'ing how a single application runs on an application server to demo'ing how multiple cloud-native Java microservices run and interact with each other.


=== Firing lazers in the Space Sentry game (2019)

Space Sentry was a game built by Prashanth Gunapalasingam and Frank Ji on Java microservices. Players controlled a lazer that was mounted on top of a 3D-printed spaceship to fire at 3D-printed targets. The movements were handled by Lego and Arduinos that communicated over Wi-Fi with three microservices running in Open Liberty containers on a Raspberry Pi.

image::img/blog/crafters-spacesentry.png[Space Sentry spaceship and lazer,width=70%,align="center"]

The three microservices communicated with each other using REST APIs (JAX-RS and MicroProfile Rest Client), and used other MicroProfile features such as MicroProfile Config, MicroProfile Health, and MicroProfile Metrics to configure and monitor the services and to post results on the leaderboard.

=== Avoiding asteroids in the Space Rover game (2022)

Space Rover is a shiny new game that has a Java microservices architecture and uses Jakarta EE 9.1 and MicroProfile 5.0 APIs. It has a physical board, made by Ellen Lau from wood and acrylic sheets with many LED lights to mark out the asteroids on the board and to give feedback when the Space Rover drives over the asteroid and when it completes the level. The Space Rover, made by Prashanth Gunapalasingam, is a 3D-printed spaceship running on a chasis with wheels and it rolls around the board in response to hand gestures captured by a webcam.

Space Rover's services make extensive use of web sockets to communicate between the components of the game (Jakarta WebSocket 2.0); REST endpoints and HTTP endpoints for communicating with the leaderboard and handling the game statistics (Jakarta JAX-RS 3.0); and interacting with the leaderboard database (Jakarta CDI 3.0).

MicroProfile technologies are used to check the status of the services and database (MicroProfile Health 4.0); to configure connections to different services and database (MicroProfile Config 3.0); to retry connection attempts to the database when there are problems (MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 4.0); to record JVM metrics on the Game service and track the latency of the Game service for the health check test (MicroProfile Metrics 3.0); to generate an HTTP client to send game end statistics to the leaderboard (MicroProfile Rest Client 3.0); and to provide REST API documentation and UI for demonstration (MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.0).

The team, Ellen and Prashanth along with Jake de Vos, Jimmy Wu, and Malhar Shah, has already started taking Space Rover to conferences where they invite attendees to use hand gestures to drive the Space Rover around the board without running into asteroids.

=== Logos made physical


==== Open Liberty lasercut logo (2019)


==== Open Liberty patchwork quilted rug mug (2022)

Finally, an Open Liberty rug mug (big coaster) can brighten up your desk and provide somewhere to host your tea and biscuits (or your Java and cookies, if you prefer). There are currently no wires, chips, pi's, or LEDs in this mini quilt. If you want to make your own mug rug, you can find the template and some instructions in GitHub [ADD LINK].
