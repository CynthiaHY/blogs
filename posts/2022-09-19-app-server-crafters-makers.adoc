Five years ago today, in 2017, link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2017/09/19/open-sourcing-liberty.html[IBM published the source code of Liberty], its Java cloud-native runtime, link:https://github.com/openliberty/open-liberty[on GitHub as the Open Liberty project]. Liberty was actually born five years earlier, in 2012, to address the need for a small footprint, extensible, and easily configurable Java runtime that could run on the cloud as well as in a data centre. Liberty was designed to provide link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/why-cloud-native-java-developers-love-liberty/[a friendly experience to developers] as well as to be powerful and flexible at runtime.

The Liberty development team were, and are, active in developing and adopting the open source link:https://microprofile.io/[Eclipse MicroProfile project], which makes Enterprise Java technologies more consumable for microservices. It made sense, then, to open-source Liberty too.

At the time, Java runtimes were mostly big and serious, but Liberty was different and Liberty's development team were inspired to make it fun. The crafters and makers in the team got to work on physical projects that used or represented Liberty in creative ways.

== Liberty running on first gen Raspberry Pi's

Even before its first release, Simon Maple (Liberty's first developer advocate) had link:https://youtu.be/cBV4tgLgDwg[run Liberty on the Raspberry Pi], which, in its recently released first incarnation, had just link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi[700 Mhz of processing power and 256 MB of memory]. He went on to demonstrate Liberty's applicability to the early Internet of Things by link:https://youtu.be/rH_SmgmyVUo[running Liberty and MQTT on a Raspberry Pi to remotely control a smart house 50 miles away].

Running Liberty on a Raspberry Pi and other hardware with limited resources sparked the imaginations of the makers within the development team.

== Early Liberty conference demos of Java EE on Liberty

One much-travelled Liberty conference demo was the link:https://github.com/WASdev/skunkworks.libertycar[remote-controlled Liberty Car], the creation of Simon's successor, Tom Banks. Tom replaced the guts of a remote-controlled car with a Raspberry Pi running Liberty plus a wifi access point:

Any conference attendee could connect and control the car from their own smartphone, demonstrating, among other things, the responsiveness of link:https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/06/ee7-websocket-support/[2013's Java EE 7 WebSocket technology]. Java EE, not then known for its small, lightweight footprint, easily ran on the limited hardware resources. Tom's Liberty Car project matured into a conference game where attendees could race multiple Liberty Cars around a large race-track. Tom talks through how it works:

== Wearable and throwable infrastructures

Liberty can run with only a tiny footprint, making it friendly to both developer laptops and the cloud. This was enabled by its original OSGi architecture which meant that any app running on Liberty could start with just minimal capabilities and then add and remove features on the fly at runtime as needed by the app.

Queen of both link:https://www.manning.com/books/enterprise-osgi-in-action[Enterprise OSGi] and the unconventional conference demo, link:https://hollycummins.com/about/[Hollie Cummins] briefly made _wearing_ a Java runtime as a hat into a thing. She sewed a Raspberry Pi into a chef's hat and ran Liberty on it. She then wore it when presenting at conferences to show that you can take servers with you to run outside of big data centres, for example in disaster zones or other environments where there isn't the usual internet infrastructure.

You can find out more from Hollie as she talks about her wearable runtime:

After a couple of years of sporting a chef's hat at Enterprise Java conferences, Hollie went further with her Java runtime crafting and made a cuddly throwable runtime. This was an actual cuddly ball with LEDs and a Raspberry Pi embedded in it which she would throw into the audience part-way through her talk and encourage them to chuck it around the room during her presentations.

== Java cloud-native microservice games

As the industry moved to microservices, so Liberty crafters and makers moved to building demos with microservice architectures rather than single-server applications. Open Liberty's bright space-related branding also lent itself well to 3D-printed spaceships and space-related games.

[.img_border_light]

link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/02/16/space-sentry-challenge.html[Space Sentry] was a game built by Prashanth Gunapalasingam and Frank Ji on Java microservices. Players controlled a laser that was mounted on top of a 3D-printed spaceship to fire at 3D-printed targets. The movements were handled by Lego and Arduinos that communicated over Wi-Fi with three microservices running in Open Liberty containers on a Raspberry Pi.

image::img/blog/crafters-spacesentry.png[Space Sentry spaceship and laser,width=70%,align="center"]

The three microservices communicated with each other using REST APIs (JAX-RS and MicroProfile Rest Client), and used other MicroProfile features such as MicroProfile Config, MicroProfile Health, and MicroProfile Metrics to configure and monitor the services and to post results on the leaderboard.

The next generation of space-themed microservices-based game came more recently in the form of Space Rover.

link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/space-rover-mission#readme[Space Rover] is a shiny, open source, new game that has a Java microservices architecture and uses Jakarta EE 9.1 and MicroProfile 5.0 APIs. It has a physical board, made by Ellen Lau from wood and acrylic sheets with many LED lights to mark out the asteroids on the board and to give feedback when the Space Rover drives over the asteroid and when it completes the level. The Space Rover, made by Prashanth Gunapalasingam, is a 3D-printed spaceship running on a chasis with wheels and it rolls around the board in response to hand gestures captured by a webcam.

Space Rover's services make extensive use of web sockets to communicate between the components of the game (Jakarta WebSocket 2.0); REST endpoints and HTTP endpoints for communicating with the leaderboard and handling the game statistics (Jakarta JAX-RS 3.0); and interacting with the leaderboard database (Jakarta CDI 3.0).

MicroProfile technologies are used to check the status of the services and database (MicroProfile Health 4.0); to configure connections to different services and database (MicroProfile Config 3.0); to retry connection attempts to the database when there are problems (MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 4.0); to record JVM metrics on the Game service and track the latency of the Game service for the health check test (MicroProfile Metrics 3.0); to generate an HTTP client to send game end statistics to the leaderboard (MicroProfile Rest Client 3.0); and to provide REST API documentation and UI for demonstration (MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.0).

The team, Ellen and Prashanth along with Jake de Vos, Jimmy Wu, and Malhar Shah, took Space Rover to DevNexus conference in Atlanta where they invited attendees to use hand gestures to drive the Space Rover around the board without running into asteroids.


== Inspired by Open Liberty

And finally, Open Liberty has also inspired projects like this Open Liberty logo made by Christopher Regan from wood and acrylic on a laser cutter:

And an Open Liberty rug mug can brighten up your desk and provide somewhere to host your tea and biscuits (or your Java and cookies, if you prefer). If you want to make your own mug rug, you can link:https://github.com/lauracowen/openliberty-rugmug/tree/main/pdfs[find the template and some instructions in GitHub].
