Serverless applications, which can scale to zero and allocate resources on demand, are certainly a hot topic in 2022. With MicroProfile widely adopted by cloud native applications, many developers want to know:

_Can MicroProfile applications be serverless?_

The short answer is YES. This post demonstrates how to get a MicroProfile application that runs on Open Liberty to run as a serverless function in IBM Cloud Code Engine by using CloudEvents.


== What is serverless?
Serverless is short for serverless computing, which is an execution model in which the cloud provider allocates resources on demand. Serverless enables developers to concentrate on their own applications without needing to manage servers. It does not mean no server is running in the background. On the contrary, serverless architecture contains servers.

Serverless normally executes code in the form of a function and is sometimes referred to “Functions as a Service” (FaaS) or "Container as a Service" (CaaS). There are a few major cloud providers that support serverless:

*	IBM Cloud Code Engine: IBM Cloud Function
*	AWS: AWS Lambda
*	Microsoft Azure: Azure Functions
*	Google Cloud: Google Cloud Functions


== CloudEvents
https://knative.dev/docs/concepts[Knative] and https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] are  two frameworks that are often used to work with the serverless model. This post focuses on CloudEvents. 

CloudEvents is a specification to describe event data in a common language-agnostic way. CloudEvents simplifies event declaration and delivery across the services and platforms. This specification is under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). CloudEvents are supported by many serverless frameworks, including IBM Cloud Code Engine.

== IBM Cloud Code Engine
https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine[IBM Cloud Code Engine](ICCE) is a fully managed, serverless platform designed to run container images, batch jobs, or source code. Code Engine allows you to build event driven workloads that react to CloudEvents. Code Engine is truly serverless. It automatically scales your workloads up and down, even down to zero when there are no requests. You pay for only the resources you consume. You can easily run your cloud native applications in Code Engine. 

== MicroProfile Applications
Many developers use MicroProfile specifications for configuring, securing, and observing cloud native applications. MicroProfile offers a set of standards APIs for cloud-native applications that free your them from vendor lock-in. Open Liberty is the leading implementation for MicroProfile specifications.

As we enter the serverless era, it is very important to get MicroProfile applications running in a serverless environment. Luckily, it is very straightforward to get these applications running as functions in an environment that supports CloudEvents, such as IBM Cloud Code Engine. In the following sections, we demonstrate how to get a MicroProfile application that is deployed to Open Liberty running as a function in IBM Cloud Code Engine with CloudEvent.

== Run MicroProfile applications  as a serverless function in Code Engine
RESTful MicroProfile Applications can run seamlessly as a serverless function in Code Engine with CloudEvent. This section explains how.

=== Prerequisites
Before you start you will need the following prerequisites:

* An IBM Cloud Account
* Docker
* An externally accessible container Registry that can host your images (IBM Cloud Container Registry is available as part of your cloud account)

=== Creating your MicroProfile application
If you don't have a suitable RESTful application to host as a set of functions you can use the https://openliberty.io/guides/getting-started.html[OpenLiberty Getting Started guide] to get a simple MicroProfile application that is  well suited to a serverless environment, such as IBM Cloud Code Engine.

If using the Getting Started code and you already have experience with OpenLiberty and MicroProfile, you can use the `finish` folder as your starting point and go to the next step. If you do not, complete the guide up to and including the https://openliberty.io/guides/getting-started.html#running-the-application-in-a-docker-container[Running the application in a Docker container] step to generate the application you'll use in this post.


After you have the application, the next step is to  test it to ensure that it is running and accessible.

Run the following command to run your container locally on its `http` port:
```
docker run -p 9080:9080 openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

To invoke the application, you can use either your browser, curl, or an API testing tool. For example you can use the following curl command:
```
curl http://localhost:9080/dev/system/properties
```
This command invokes the `getProperties()` method in the application's `SystemResource` class

=== Deploying your application to a container registry to prepare for IBM Cloud Code Engine
Having sucessfully built and tested your image locally, you now need to put it somewhere that IBM Cloud Code Engine can get to it.

ICCE supports two primary methods to get your code into a runnable format

* https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code[From source code respository] e.g. Github
* From a externally accessible Container Registry:
** https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app[Public Registry] e.g. DockerHub
** https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage[IBM Cloud Container Registry] - available as part of your IBM Cloud account
** https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-private[Private Registry]

Given to follow this blog, you will have an IBM Cloud Account, IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICCR) provides the quickest route to getting your image up and running.

=== Creating your IBM Cloud Code Engine application
With your image uploaded, you now need to create and configure you IBM Cloud Code Engine application to make your function available.

If you used ICCR follow these https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage[steps to create your application using ICCR]. If your used one of the other types of registry follow the matching Application creating instructions.

When you create your application, consider the following options:

Image reference::
While the name of your image will stay the same, you will be updating it later.  Consider whether to use the image hash that is within the registry or the tag you uploaded with that.  Be aware that an update to the image may not be reflected when executed in ICCE if it uses the old tag.
Resource allocation:: 
As part of the application definition, you can tell ICCE how much CPU and Memory to allocate to any running instances. While the application is small, it is still a Java application that needs a period of startup before it can start serving requests. The Getting Started image will eventually start on the minimum values, but giving it slightly more will significantly improve startup and response time.
Listening port::
Use port 9080 as the value for the listening port. For more information, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#considerationshttphandlingapp[Considerations for HTTP handling].

After you create your application, ensure that it is not showing any errors such as `Missing Pull credentials`, which indicates that the image cannot be pulled to run. If you have any of these errors, follow the steps in the ICCE documentation to resolve. Some errors may occur only when the application is invoked for the first time.

=== Invoking your application on IBM Cloud Code Engine
Now that you have the application, you can invoke it within ICCE

As part of creating your application, you obtained the URL from the test application or the CLI. if you did not obtain it via these means, you can follow https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-access-servICCE[accessing your app].

If you make a request to `https://{ICCE_Application_URL}/` you should see the `Welcome to Open Liberty` page

To call the application on ICCE, we use the same path that we used for the application locally. Run the following `curl` command
```
curl https://${ICCE_Application_URL}/dev/system/properties
```

After a short time, you should see a response with a JSON payload containing all the system properties.

Note: All ICCE connections are HTTPS. so while `http` was used locally, the image is configured to support HTTPS without any changes.

Congratulations! You just called your application on IBM Cloud Code Engine.

 If you open the IBM Cloud Code Engine UI to your application's **Overview** tab, you can see the active instances while you are making requests. You will use this page when you start making requests to observe IBM Cloud Code Engine creating the application instance and then scaling down to zero when it stops receiving work.

A common use case for serverless applications is to process events coming from non-HTTP sources, such as Kafka topics or IBM Cloud Object Storage. Historically, to consume these events the application had to make use of the cloud provider's SDK, which locks the application into that provider. This is where CloudEvents comes in, as it provides a cross-provider standard around which data can be transmitted and received by an application, improving portability and reducing large dependencies.


=== Updating the application to use CloudEvents
IBM Cloud Code Engine connects IBM Cloud event providers such as https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-working-kafkaevent-producer#setup-kafka-receiverapp[Kafka] or https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-eventing-cosevent-producer#obstorage_ev_app[IBM Cloud Object Storage] and the application by using CloudEvents. These events are sent to a subscribed application as HTTP POST requests. Because the requests are in HTTP format, a RESTful application can receive these events without needing additional libraries and configuration.

To include the CloudEvents `restful-ws` library within the application, Add the following https://openliberty.io/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven] dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cloudevents</groupId>
    <artifactId>cloudevents-http-restful-ws-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or if you use https://openliberty.io/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:
```
dependencies {
	implementation group: 'io.cloudevents', name: 'cloudevents-http-restful-ws', version: '2.5.0'}

```

Two `restful-ws` packages are provided for CloudEvents:

* `restful-ws` supports Jakarta EE 8 and the `javax.*` namespace
* `restful-ws-jakarta` supports Jakarta EE 9+ and the `jakarta.*` namespace*

The CloudEvent 2.5.0 release, the first release of the `restful-ws-jakarta` package, is at the time of this writing  not  yet available. If you want to use the new package before its release, you can build the package locally and store it in a suitable Maven repository for use with your application build. If you build from source,  change the version  to `2.5.0-SNAPSHOT`. You can find the source at https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-java/tree/master/http/restful-ws-jakarta[HTTP Protocol Binding for Jakarta EE9+ - Jakarta RESTful Web Services].

When run within the context of Open Liberty, the `CloudEventsProvider` class is automatically configured for marshalling and unmarshalling of CloudEvents.

With the library imported, you can now update the application to use CloudEvents.

The following sections guide you through updating the `SystemResource` class from the Getting Started guide  to use CloudEvents. You can view the <<completed_class>> to check that changes you make align with the expected result.

==== Returning a CloudEvent

First, update the `SystemResource` class  response Type from `Response` to `CloudEvent`. In the method declaration, replace `Response` with `CloudEvent`:

For the Method Declaration replace `Response` with `CloudEvent`
```
public CloudEvent getProperties() {
```

Now need to construct a CloudEvent to return. However, first we need to do some work on the system properties to be able to include them as the data within the event.

CloudEvents cannot convert the data from Object to `byte[]` and requires the data to be in a binary format when it is provided during its building process. As such, we can take the properties from `System.getProperties()` and make them into a JSON string by using `Jsonb`.
```
/* java.util.properties does not have a direct way to obtain a byte[] so store in an intermediary Map first*/
    Map properties = System.getProperties();
    Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();
/* convert properties map into a JSON string which can then be converted into a byte[]*/
    String jsonString = jsonb.toJson(properties);

```

With our data in string format, we can now get the `byte[]` representation of the data.

The `CloudEventBuilder` class provides the necessary components to build our CloudEvent.  Use the most recent specification version, which is `v1()`.
```
    return CloudEventBuilder.v1()
        .withData(jsonString.getBytes())
        .withDataContentType("application/json")
        .withId("properties")
        .withType("java.properties")
        .withSource(URI.create("http://system.poperties"))
        .build();
```
Besides `withData()`, the rest of the methods set the values that will be returned as headers in the response.
Once all the required properties are set, you can build the CloudEvent Object.

If you are missing any required properties when your application attempts to build the CloudEvent, an exception will be thrown that informs you of a missing property. To see which properties are required, you can review the https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md[specification].

Because CloudEvents can be from a wide variety of sources that might differ even within a single provider, the majority of the fields are fairly free-form.

==== Receiving a CloudEvent
Now that we've returned a CloudEvent, how is it handled within the application?

First, we'll enhance the `SystemResource` class to add a query method that can send a POST request with a body that contains the system properties that we want returned.

The body of the request will be a JSON array that contains each property we want as an a member.
```
["java.vendor.url","awt.toolkit"]
```

Add the following method declaration to the `SystemResource` class.
```
    @POST
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Timed(name = "queryPropertiesTime",
            description = "Time needed to query the JVM system properties")
    @Counted(absolute = true, description
            = "Number of times the JVM system properties are queried")
    public CloudEvent queryProperties(CloudEvent query){


}
```
In this case, we will return a CloudEvent, but you can return any type that confirms the request was received, such as `Response.ok().build();`

Inside the method, we need to do some of the same things that we did within  the `getProperties()` method. But we also must handle the CloudEvent input.

For some initial structure, add this block to the top of the method.
```
Map properties = System.getProperties();
HashMap<String,String> props = new HashMap<>((Map<String,String>)properties);
HashMap<String,String> qProps = new HashMap<String,String>();
Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();
```
This gives us the Map of the properties, but in a form that is more useful later as we need to do more processing then we did within `getProperties()`

To retrieve the data from the CloudEvent, we use `.withData();` to extra and Object of type CloudEventData, the data portion is in binary format, so needs to be converted to make it usable.
```
/* Pull data from the data portion of the CloudEvent - this is in binary format so convert it into a standard String*/
CloudEventData data = query.getData();
String jsonString = new String(data.toBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
The conversion to a string is the quickest way if you know the input will be in JSON format. You can check what the sender claims it has sent you can validate via inspect the Data Content Type from `getDataContentType()`

With the data now in a more usable format, we can start to process it and make use of its contents.

Because we have a JSON array, we can use `jsonb` to convert the JSON to an `ArrayList` of the keys that are requested from the properties `HashMap`.
```
/* Take the Json Array data and use that to pull out the request properties */
ArrayList<String> tProps = jsonb.fromJson(jsonString, ArrayList.class);
for(String key: tProps){
    qProps.put(key, props.get(key));
}
```
We use the other hashmap created at the start to store the properties we queried for.

Now that we have built our map of queried properties, it can be returned to the user in the same way we returned
```
return CloudEventBuilder.v1()
    .withData(jsonb.toJson(qProps).getBytes())
    .withDataContentType("application/json")
    .withId("properties")
    .withType("java.properties")
    .withSource(URI.create("http://system.poperties"))
    .build();
```

Next, we're ready to test the new method.

To invoke the new method, we make a POST request against `/dev/system/properties` with the HTTP request being a CloudEvent. You can do this locally, or against a rebuilt Docker image.

To invoke this method, use the following curl command:
```
curl -X POST http://${url}/dev/system/properties \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: properties" \
-H "Ce-Source: io.cloudevents.examples/properties" \
-H "Ce-Id: 536808d3-88be-4077-9d7a-a3f162705f78" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ce-Subject: resources" \
-d "[\"java.vendor.url\",\"awt.toolkit\"]"
```

In the same way when we returned a CloudEvent, when we make the request, we need to provide the required set of headers so that the application can correctly convert the request into a CloudEvent.

==== Completed CloudEvent SystemResource class [[completed_class]]
Once complete, the SystemResource class should look very similar to this:

}
```


=== Updating your IBM Cloud Code Engine application
The application can now return and receive CloudEvents.  We're can update our application in ICCE.
To update your application

1. Rebuild your Liberty application with the CloudEvent changes.
2. Rebuild your docker container and publish to it ICCR, either by updating the version or leaving it as is if you are using the image hash
3. https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-app#update-app-crimage-console[Update your ICCE application] to use the new version.

With your application updated you can validate your changes in ICCE by invoking using the previous curl commands.
