Serverless applications, which can scale to zero and allocate resources on demand, are certainly a hot topic in 2022. With MicroProfile widely adopted by cloud native applications, many developers want to know:

_Can MicroProfile applications be serverless?_

The short answer is YES. This post demonstrates how to get a MicroProfile application that runs on Open Liberty to run as a serverless function in IBM Cloud Code Engine by using CloudEvents.


== What is serverless?
Serverless is short for serverless computing, which is an execution model in which the cloud provider allocates resources on demand. Serverless enables you to concentrate on your applications without needing to manage servers. It does not mean no server is running in the background. On the contrary, serverless architecture contains servers.

Serverless normally executes code in the form of a function and is sometimes referred to _Functions as a Service_ (FaaS) or _Container as a Service_ (CaaS). A few major cloud providers support serverless applications:

*	IBM Cloud Code Engine: IBM Cloud Function
*	AWS: AWS Lambda
*	Microsoft Azure: Azure Functions
*	Google Cloud: Google Cloud Functions

This post uses the following specifications and frameworks to create and run a serverless application.

CloudEvents::
https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a specification to describe event data in a common language-agnostic way. CloudEvents simplifies event declaration and delivery across the services and platforms. This specification is under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). CloudEvents are supported by many serverless frameworks, including IBM Cloud Code Engine.

IBM Cloud Code Engine::
https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine[IBM Cloud Code Engine] (ICCE) is a fully managed, serverless platform designed to run container images, batch jobs, or source code. Code Engine allows you to build event driven workloads that react to CloudEvents. Code Engine is truly serverless. It automatically scales your workloads up and down, even down to zero when there are no requests. You pay for only the resources you consume. You can easily run your cloud native applications in Code Engine.

MicroProfile::
Many developers use https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile] specifications for configuring, securing, and observing cloud native applications. MicroProfile offers a set of standard APIs for cloud-native applications that free your applications from vendor lock-in. Open Liberty is the leading implementation for MicroProfile specifications.

As we enter the serverless era, it is very important to get MicroProfile applications running in a serverless environment. Luckily, it is very straightforward to get these applications running as functions in an environment that supports CloudEvents, such as IBM Cloud Code Engine. In the following sections, we demonstrate how to get a MicroProfile application that is deployed to Open Liberty running as a function in IBM Cloud Code Engine with CloudEvents.

== Run MicroProfile applications  as a serverless function in Code Engine
RESTful MicroProfile applications can run seamlessly as a serverless function in Code Engine with CloudEvent. This section explains how.

=== Prerequisites
Before you start you will need the following prerequisites:

* An https://www.ibm.com/cloud[IBM Cloud] Account
* Docker
* Git CLI
* Maven
* An externally accessible container registry that can host your images. This post focuses on https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry[IBM Cloud Container Registry], which is available as part of your IBM Cloud account.

=== Create your MicroProfile application
In this post, we use the https://openliberty.io/guides/getting-started.html[OpenLiberty Getting Started guide] to get a simple MicroProfile application that is  well suited to a serverless environment, such as IBM Cloud Code Engine.

If you already have experience with OpenLiberty and MicroProfile, you can use the application files in the `finish` folder of the Getting Started Guide as your starting point and go to the next step. If you are new to Open Liberty, complete the guide up to and including the https://openliberty.io/guides/getting-started.html#running-the-application-in-a-docker-container[Running the application in a Docker container] step to generate the application you'll use in this post.

After you have the application, the next step is to  test it to ensure that it is running and accessible.

Run the following command to run your container locally on its `http` port:
```
docker run -p 9080:9080 openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

To invoke the application, you can use either your browser, curl, or an API testing tool. For example, you can use the following curl command:
```
curl http://localhost:9080/dev/system/properties
```
This command invokes the `getProperties()` method in the application's `SystemResource` class.

=== Deploy your application to IBM Cloud Container Registry to prepare for IBM Cloud Code Engine
After you successfully build and test your image locally, you now need to put it somewhere that IBM Cloud Code Engine can get to it.

With ICCE, you can get your code into a runnable format either by using https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code[a source code respository], such as GitHub, or an externally accessible container registry, such as a https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app[Public Registry] (eg. DockerHub), https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage[IBM Cloud Container Registry], or a https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-private[private registry].

Since you already have a IBM Cloud account, this post focuses on IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICCR), which provides the quickest route to getting your image up and running. Log in to your IBM Cloud account and https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage[follow these steps] to upload your image.

=== Create your IBM Cloud Code Engine application
With your image uploaded, you now need to create and configure your IBM Cloud Code Engine application to make your function available.

https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-deploy-app-crimage[Follow these steps] to create your application using ICCR.

When you create your application, consider the following options:

Image reference::
While the name of your image will stay the same, you will be updating it later.  Consider whether to use the image hash that is within the registry or the tag you uploaded with that.  Be aware that an update to the image may not be reflected when executed in ICCE if it uses the old tag.
Resource allocation::
As part of the application definition, you can tell ICCE how much CPU and Memory to allocate to any running instances. While the application is small, it is still a Java application that needs a period of startup before it can start serving requests. The Getting Started image will eventually start on the minimum values, but giving it slightly more will significantly improve startup and response time.
Listening port::
Use port 9080 as the value for the listening port. For more information, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#considerationshttphandlingapp[Considerations for HTTP handling].

After you create your application, ensure that it is not showing any errors such as `Missing Pull credentials`, which indicates that the image cannot be pulled to run. If you have any of these errors, follow the steps in the ICCE documentation to resolve. Some errors might occur only when the application is invoked for the first time.

=== Invoke your application on IBM Cloud Code Engine
Now that you have the application, you can invoke it within ICCE.

As part of creating your application on ICCE, you obtained the application URL from the test application or the command line. If you did not get the URL, follow https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-access-service[these steps] to get it.

If you make a request to `\https://{ICCE_Application_URL}/`, you should see the `Welcome to Open Liberty` page.

To call the application on ICCE, we use the same path that we used for the application locally. Run the following `curl` command:
```
curl https://${ICCE_Application_URL}/dev/system/properties
```

After a short time, you should see a response with a JSON payload that contains all the system properties.

All ICCE connections are HTTPS. so while `http` was used locally, the image is configured to support HTTPS without any changes.

Congratulations! You just called your application on IBM Cloud Code Engine.

If you open the IBM Cloud Code Engine UI to your application's **Overview** tab, you can see the active instances while you are making requests. You will use this page when you start making requests to observe IBM Cloud Code Engine creating the application instance and then scaling down to zero when it stops receiving work.

=== Updating the application to use CloudEvents
A common use case for serverless applications is to process events coming from non-HTTP sources, such as Kafka topics or IBM Cloud Object Storage. Historically, to consume these events the application had to make use of the cloud provider's SDK, which locks the application into that provider. This is where CloudEvents comes in, as it provides a cross-provider standard around which data can be transmitted and received by an application, improving portability and reducing large dependencies.

ICCE connects event providers such as https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-working-kafkaevent-producer#setup-kafka-receiverapp[Kafka] or https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-eventing-cosevent-producer#obstorage_ev_app[IBM Cloud Object Storage] to the application by using CloudEvents. These events are sent to a subscribed application as HTTP POST requests. Because the requests are in HTTP format, a RESTful application can receive these events without needing additional libraries and configuration.

The CloudEvent 2.5.0 release, the first release of the `restful-ws-jakarta` package that we use to add CloudEvent support, is at the time of this writing is not yet publically available. As such it needs to be built locally

To build the `restful-ws-jakarta` package and its pre-requisites
1. Clone https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-java
2. Go to the `sdk-java/api` directory
3. Run `mvn clean install`
4. Go to the `sdk-java/core` directory
5. Run `mvn clean install`
6. Go to the `sdk-java/http/restful-ws-jakarta` directory
7. Run `mvn clean install`

To include the CloudEvents `restful-ws-jakarta` library within the application with https://openliberty.io/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven] add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cloudevents</groupId>
    <artifactId>cloudevents-http-restful-ws-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

When run within the context of Open Liberty, the `CloudEventsProvider` class is automatically configured for marshalling and unmarshalling of CloudEvents.

With the library included, you can now update the application to use CloudEvents.

The following sections guide you through updating the `SystemResource` class from the Getting Started guide application to use CloudEvents.

==== Completed CloudEvents SystemResource class [[completed_class]]
Before you begin to update the `SystemResource` class, take a moment to review the the Completed CloudEvents SystemResource class, which contains all the code changes you will implement in the following sections. You can refer back to this example to check that changes you make align with the expected result.
Once complete, the SystemResource class should look very similar to this:

        String jsonString = new String(data.toBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

        /* Take the Json Array data and use that to pull out the request properties */
        ArrayList<String> tProps = jsonb.fromJson(jsonString, ArrayList.class);
        for(String key: tProps){
            qProps.put(key, props.get(key));
        }

        /* return a CloudEvent with our queried properties */
        return CloudEventBuilder.v1()
                .withData(jsonb.toJson(qProps).getBytes())
                .withDataContentType("application/json")
                .withId("properties")
                .withType("java.properties")
                .withSource(URI.create("http://system.poperties"))
                .build();
    }

}
```

==== Returning a CloudEvent

First, update the `SystemResource` class response Type from `Response` to `CloudEvent`. In the method declaration, replace `Response` with `CloudEvent`:

```
public CloudEvent getProperties() {
```

Now, we need to construct a CloudEvent to return. However, first we need to do some work on the system properties to be able to include them as the data within the event.

CloudEvents cannot convert the data from Object to `byte[]` and requires the data to be in a binary format when it is provided during its building process. As such, we can take the properties from `System.getProperties()` and make them into a JSON string by using `Jsonb`.
```
/* java.util.properties does not have a direct way to obtain a byte[] so store in an intermediary Map first*/
    Map properties = System.getProperties();
    Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();
/* convert properties map into a JSON string which can then be converted into a byte[]*/
    String jsonString = jsonb.toJson(properties);

```

With our data in string format, we can now get the `byte[]` representation of the data.

The `CloudEventBuilder` class provides the necessary components to build our CloudEvent.  Use the most recent specification version, which is `v1()`.
```
    return CloudEventBuilder.v1()
        .withData(jsonString.getBytes())
        .withDataContentType("application/json")
        .withId("properties")
        .withType("java.properties")
        .withSource(URI.create("http://system.poperties"))
        .build();
```
Besides `withData()`, the rest of the methods set the values that will be returned as headers in the response.
Once all the required properties are set, you can build the CloudEvent Object.

This sample provides only the required properties for a valid `CloudEvent`. If any of these properties are missing then an exception is thrown. To see which properties are required, you can review the https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md[specification].

Because CloudEvents can be from a wide variety of sources that might differ even within a single provider, the majority of the fields are fairly free-form.

==== Receiving a CloudEvent
Now that we've returned a CloudEvent, how can we receive one in the application?

First, we'll enhance the `SystemResource` class to add a query method that can send a POST request with a body that contains the system properties that we want returned.

The body of the request will be a JSON array that contains each property we want returned as part of the request.
```
["java.vendor.url","awt.toolkit"]
```

Add the following method declaration to the `SystemResource` class.
```
    @POST
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Timed(name = "queryPropertiesTime",
            description = "Time needed to query the JVM system properties")
    @Counted(absolute = true, description
            = "Number of times the JVM system properties are queried")
    public CloudEvent queryProperties(CloudEvent query){


}
```
In this case, we will return a CloudEvent, but you can return any type that confirms the request was received, such as `Response.ok().build();`

Inside the method, we need to do some of the same things that we did within  the `getProperties()` method. But we also must handle the CloudEvent input.

For some initial structure, add this block to the top of the method.
```
Map properties = System.getProperties();
HashMap<String,String> props = new HashMap<>((Map<String,String>)properties);
HashMap<String,String> qProps = new HashMap<String,String>();
Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();
```
This block gives us the Map of the properties, but in a form that is more useful, as we need to do more processing then we did within the `getProperties()` method.

To retrieve the data from the CloudEvent, we use `.withData();` to extract the payload as an instance of CloudEventData. The data is in binary format, so needs to be converted to make it usable.
```
/* Pull data from the data portion of the CloudEvent - this is in binary format so convert it into a standard String*/
CloudEventData data = query.getData();
String jsonString = new String(data.toBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
The conversion to a String allows us to process the JSON payload later. You can check what the data-type that has been by inspecting the Data Content Type from `getDataContentType()` on the CloudEvent.

With the data now in a more usable format, we can start to process it and make use of its contents.

Because we have a JSON array, we can use `jsonb` to convert the JSON to an `ArrayList` of the keys that are requested from the properties `HashMap`.
```
/* Take the Json Array data and use that to pull out the request properties */
ArrayList<String> tProps = jsonb.fromJson(jsonString, ArrayList.class);
for(String key: tProps){
    qProps.put(key, props.get(key));
}
```
We use the other hashmap created at the start to store the properties we queried for.

Now that we have built our map of queried properties, it can be returned to the user in the same way we returned the full list of properties.
```
return CloudEventBuilder.v1()
    .withData(jsonb.toJson(qProps).getBytes())
    .withDataContentType("application/json")
    .withId("properties")
    .withType("java.properties")
    .withSource(URI.create("http://system.poperties"))
    .build();
```

Next, we're ready to test the new method.

To invoke the method, we make a POST request against `/dev/system/properties` with the HTTP request being a CloudEvent. You can do this locally, or against a rebuilt Docker image.

To invoke this method, use the following curl command:
```
curl -X POST http://${url}/dev/system/properties \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: properties" \
-H "Ce-Source: io.cloudevents.examples/properties" \
-H "Ce-Id: 536808d3-88be-4077-9d7a-a3f162705f78" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ce-Subject: resources" \
-d "[\"java.vendor.url\",\"awt.toolkit\"]"
```

In the same way that we returned a CloudEvent, when we make the request, we need to provide the required set of headers so that the application can correctly convert the request into a CloudEvent.

=== Updating your IBM Cloud Code Engine application
The application can now return and receive CloudEvents.  We can update our application in ICCE.

To update your application, complete the following steps:

1. Rebuild your Liberty application with the CloudEvent changes.
2. Rebuild your docker container and publish to it ICCR, either by updating the image tag or leaving it as is if you are using the image hash
3. https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-update-app#update-app-crimage-console[Update your ICCE application] to use the new version.

After you update your application, you can validate your changes in ICCE by invoking the same curl commands that we used locally, but replacing the protocol and hostname.
```
curl -X POST https://${ICCE_Application_URL}/dev/system/properties \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: properties" \
-H "Ce-Source: io.cloudevents.examples/properties" \
-H "Ce-Id: 536808d3-88be-4077-9d7a-a3f162705f78" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ce-Subject: resources" \
-d "[\"java.vendor.url\",\"awt.toolkit\"]"
```

You now have a MicroProfile application on Open Liberty running on IBM Cloud Code Engine that handles CloudEvents.
