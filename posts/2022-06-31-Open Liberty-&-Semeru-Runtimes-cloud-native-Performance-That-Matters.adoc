Open Liberty and the IBM Semeru Runtimes JDK are perfectly matched to get the cloud native experience developers expect out of a modern runtime stack, including the best performance and throughput. These two technologies were developed for modern developers in the Java community who want to get the most out of their Java applications, no matter where those applications are running. 
The world has moved to a more cloud-native approach that fundamentally changes the way software developers design and build applications. Open Liberty and the IBM Semeru runtimes JVM have fully embraced this approach to create some of the best performing technologies in this space. 
Open Liberty is a runtime developed for this purpose, with developer experience at its heart. The OpenJ9 JVM is built to suit the cloud-native approach, boasting https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/10/30/faster-startup-open-liberty[start-up times of around 1s with Open Liberty].  In this post, I'll explain why these two technologies are a great solution for your cloud-native needs and provide some performance data to back up my claims!

## About OpenJ9/Semeru Runtimes
OpenJ9 is the JVM that IBM Semeru Runtimes JDK is based upon. It is a robust JVM because IBM customers have been using it the past 25 years. It was given to the Open-source community (Eclipse Foundation) and has since gone through some major changes to make it a great option for your cloud-native Java applications. This JVM has some great performance characteristics that enable Java developers to get the most out of their applications. It can scale from small to large and has some of the best throughput statistics of any JVM.  It also provides functions, such as class cache sharing and remote JIT servers, that make your applications perform to the highest standards. For some specific performance data on the OpenJ9 JVM you can check https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/performance[this article with testimonies of people that have used it].

## Why these technologies are a great match
Semeru runtimes, along with Open Liberty, is one of the biggest contributions that IBM has ever donated to the open source community. It has been used by many of the world’s biggest enterprises due to its robustness and performance. It has changed characteristics over the years to take advantage of what the cloud offers and is now one of the best performing JVM choices for the cloud. This JVM, coupled with Open Liberty, has some great performance benefits that we as developers expect from modern cloud-native technologies. 

Thanks to contributions in the open-source communities of these technologies, we in the Open Liberty org have  made improvements to both the Open Liberty runtime and the OpenJ9 JVM that dramatically improve  start-up time, throughput, ramp-up time,  usability, and more. Start up time is around 1s using technologies such as OpenJ9’s Class Cache sharing. Using the OpenJ9 JIT server technology is great if you are working in constrained environments and want https://developer.ibm.com/articles/jitserver-optimize-your-java-cloud-native-applications/?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=jit%20server[great throughput]. Ramp-up time is also important. The time it takes for your stack to get warmed up is wasted time that is costing you resources. OpenJ9 has https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/performance/[great ramp-up time] that is perfect for short lived stacks in the cloud. In regards to usability, https://openliberty.io/blog/2021/04/30/dev-mode-with-aot.html[Open Liberty’s dev-mode function] enables you to take advantage of OpenJ9’s performance, so you can focus on the code and let the runtime automatically deploy your changes. You can focus on what you love and be more productive.

## How get started with these technologies
If you wanted to get started with this Java stack, then the easiest way is by downloading the Open Liberty container as this already has the Semeru runtimes JVM pre-installed with some of the functionality mentioned above pre-enabled. You can also get Semeru Runtimes from the Eclipse Adoptium marketplace as mentioned about https://adoptium.net/marketplace/[Marketplace | Adoptium].

## Summary
From this post, you can hopefully see some of the benefits of using OpenJ9/Semeru Runtimes with the Open Liberty runtime . Whether you are still building monoliths or creating microservices, you will find performance benefits using this Open source stack. 

For more information on why Open Liberty is a great runtime choice, check outhttps://developer.ibm.com/articles/why-cloud-native-java-developers-love-liberty/[Why cloud-native Java developers love Liberty].
