Open Liberty 22.0.0.13 provides the ability to automatically purge FFDC log files after they reach a configured age. This release also provides many significant bug fixes, including two that address CVEs in gRPC and gRPC Client.  Two new guides, covering the topics of gRPC and WebSocket, also join our extensive list of guides.
If you're interested in features and functionality which we have in progress, like Jakarta EE 10, MicroProfile 6, and InstantOn, take a look at the recent link:https://openliberty.io/blog/?search=beta&key=tag[beta blog posts].

[#maxFfdcAge]
== Configurable maximum FFDC age
   
Open Liberty provides First Failure Data Capture(FFDC) capability which instantly collects information about events and conditions that might lead up to a failure.  In certain scenarios, the number of files in the FFDC directory can grow to a very large amount. Currently, Open Liberty automatically purges FFDC files in excess of 500 and this value is not configurable. This beta release introduces new functionality which automatically purges FFDC log files after they reach a configured age. This is done through a new configuration attribute, `maxFfdcAge`.


`maxFfdcAge` is the maximum desired age before an FFDC file is deleted. At midnight everyday, any FFDC file that has reached the maximum configured age will be deleted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be days (`d`), hours (`h`), or minutes (`m`). For example, specify 2 days as `2d`. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, `2d6h` is equivalent to 2 days and 6 hours.
    
Example server.xml configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<server>
    <logging maxFfdcAge="2d"/>
</server>

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A220013+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.13].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23478[NullPointerException in InstallFeatureAction for .esa files]
+
A bug introduced in the featureUtility command caused a `NullPointerException` to occur when trying to install a feature with using the Enterprise Subsystem Archive (ESA) packaging denoted by an `.esa` extension.
+
[source]
----
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.ibm.ws.install.internal.InstallUtils.getFeatureName(InstallUtils.java:794)
        at com.ibm.ws.install.featureUtility.cli.InstallFeatureAction.esaInstallInit(InstallFeatureAction.java:188)
        ....
----
+
This is has been resolved, and invoking `./featureUtility installFeature x.esa` to install ESA features no longer throw an NPE.


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23403[HTTP/2 Intermittent server quiesce failure when stream is closed with an exception]
+
An intermittent issue can occur causing threads to hang when an exception occurs on an HTTP/2 connection. This results in a quiesce warning being issued during a server stop.
+
The issue has been resolved and the HTTP/2 streams and connections and the threads managing now stop without error, even in exception conditions.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23326[Liberty default HttpAuthenticationMechanisms do not call HttpMessageContext.responseUnauthorized]
+
`HttpMessageContextWrapper` should be able to override the `responseUnauthorized` method. Due to a bug, Liberty's `HttpAuthenticationMechanisms` did not call `HttpMessageContext.responseUnauthorized` preventing users from to enriching the response, like adding headers.
+
This issue has been resolved and the default `HttpAuthenticationMechanisms` now properly calls `HttpMessageContext.responseUnauthorized` for unauthorized requests.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23146[JspFactory.getDefaultFactory().getEngineInfo().getSpecificationVersion() return incorrect version]
+
If a Pages, formerly known as JSP,  application calls `JspFactory.getDefaultFactory().getEngineInfo().getSpecificationVersion()` then a wrong version is returned. The value is coded to return `2.1` rather than the correct specification version.  
+
The issue has been resolved, and the correct version is now returned.  For example, `jsp-2.2` returns `2.2` and `pages-3.0` returns `3.0`.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22405[OidcClientImpl does not properly declare a dependency on SecurityService]
+
When invoking `request.logout()` from a `ServletFilter` intercepting traffic to form-based logout URL `ibm_security_logout`, the following NPE can occur:
[source]
----
java.lang.NullPointerException
Stack Dump = java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.ibm.ws.security.openidconnect.client.internal.OidcClientImpl.authenticateSubject(OidcClientImpl.java:749)

        at com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.security.AuthenticateApi.logout(AuthenticateApi.java:189)

        at com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.filter.FilterInstanceWrapper.doFilter(FilterInstanceWrapper.java:201)
----
+
The issue has been resolved by declaring `OidcClientImpl` dependent on `SecurityService` and the NPE no longer occurs.
