Jakarta Data is a new Jakarta EE specification that aims to standardize the popular Data Repository pattern across relational and NoSQL databases. As the specification is further developed and Jakarta Data providers become available, it is expected that the Jakarta Data specification will standardize a way to plug in your favorite providers that are currently dominant in the industry, including JNoSQL, to be used in Open Liberty. For now, Open Liberty is making available as beta a test implementation of Jakarta Data that we are using to experiment with proposed specification features so that developers can try out these features and provide feedback to influence the specification as it is being developed. The test implementation currently works with relational databases and operates by redirecting repository operations to the built-in Jakarta Persistence provider. It simulates the entirety of the Jakarta Data beta 2 release, plus some additional proposed features that are being considered.

Jakarta Data beta 2 allows you to combine multiple ways of specifying ordering and sorting, defining a precedence.  Sorting defined by `OrderBy` (annotation or query-by-method keyword) is applied first, followed by `Sort` parameters (on the method or `Pageable`).

To use Jakarta Data, you start by defining an entity class that corresponds to your data. With relational databases, the entity class corresponds to a database table and the entity properties (public methods and fields of the entity class) generally correspond to the columns of the table. An entity class can be:

- annotated with `jakarta.persistence.Entity` and related annotations from Jakarta Persistence
- a Java class without entity annotations, in which case the primary key is inferred from an entity property named `id` or ending with `Id`.

You define one or more repository interfaces for an entity, annotate those interfaces as `@Repository` and inject them into components via CDI. The Jakarta Data provider supplies the implementation of the repository interface for you.

Here's a simple entity, repository, and usage of it.

```
public class Product { // entity
    public long id;
    public String name;
    public float price;
}

@Repository
public interface Products {
    Product findById(long productId);

    @OrderBy("price")
    List<Product> findByNameContains(String searchFor);

    @Query("UPDATE Product o SET o.price = o.price - (?2 * o.price) WHERE o.id = ?1")
    boolean discount(long productId, float discountRate);

    void save(Product p);
}

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Inject
    Products products;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        List<Product> found = products.findByNameContains(searchFor);
        ...
    }
}
```

Refer to a link:https://github.com/jakartaee/data/blob/main/spec/src/main/asciidoc/repository.asciidoc[draft of the Jakarta Data specification] and the link:https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=jakarta/data/jakarta-data-api/1.0.0-b2/jakarta-data-api-1.0.0-b2-javadoc.jar[jakarta.data.repository.Repository JavaDoc] for instructions on how to properly form repository methods so that the Jakarta Data provider understands them.

You can optionally have your repository interface inherit from built-in interfaces such as `jakarta.data.repository.CrudRepository` that define commonly used methods like `findById` and `save` for you,

```
@Repository
public interface Products extends CrudRepository<Product, Long> {
    @OrderBy("price")
    List<Product> findByNameContains(String searchFor);

    @Query("UPDATE Product o SET o.price = o.price - (?2 * o.price) WHERE o.id = ?1")
    boolean discount(long productId, float discountRate);
}
```

Jakarta Data has not yet defined a standard configuration model. For now, the Open Liberty beta reuses the existing `defaultDatabaseStore` configuration (which defaults to the `DefaultDataSource` data source) for Jakarta Data. This means the beta of Jakarta Data is currently limited to a single data source. This of course will change as the specification defines more of a configuration model. The `data-1.0` Liberty beta feature makes the Jakarta Data API available, and you also need a feature for Jakarta Persistence or JDBC (or at some point in the future, Jakarta NoSQL).

Example server.xml configuration:

```
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>data-1.0</feature>
    <feature>persistence-3.1</feature> <!-- could use jdbc-4.3 instead -->
    <feature>servlet-6.0</feature> <!-- the example includes a servlet -->
  </featureManager>

  <dataSource id="DefaultDataSource">
    <jdbcDriver libraryRef="PostgreSQL"/>
    <properties.postgresql databaseName="testdb" serverName="localhost" portNumber="5432"/>
    <containerAuthData user="dbuser1" password="dbpwd1"/>
  </dataSource>

  <library id="PostgreSQL">
    <file name="${shared.resource.dir}/jdbc/postgresql.jar"/>
  </library>

  <!-- optional because the following are all defaulted: -->
  <databaseStore id="defaultDatabaseStore" createTables="true" dropTables="false"
          tablePrefix="WLP" dataSourceRef="DefaultDataSource"/>
</server>
```

You can find th 1.0.0-b2 beta release of Jakarta Data on link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/jakarta.data/jakarta-data-api/1.0.0-b2/jar[Maven], which corresponds to the Open Liberty 23.0.0.4 beta.

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta-data-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-b2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Experimental Function in the Beta of Jakarta Data

This beta provides some additional function that is under consideration for Jakarta Data, but not in the Jakarta Data 1.0.0-b1 beta.

When a global transaction is active on the thread on which a repository operation executes, the repository operation enlists as part of the transaction if the data source that backs the repository is capable of enlistment. Transaction enlistment is default for relational databases, but can be switched off by configuring the data source configuration attribute `transactional` to `false`.

You can use the `@Asynchronous` annotation from Jakarta Concurrency on repository methods to enable them to run asynchronously. This requires the `concurrent-3.0` feature.

```
@Repository
public interface Products extends CrudRepository<Product, Long> {
    @Asynchronous
    @OrderBy("price")
    CompletableFuture<List<Product>> findByNameContains(String searchFor);

    @Asynchronous
    @Query("UPDATE Product o SET o.price = o.price - (?2 * o.price) WHERE o.id = ?1")
    CompletionStage<Boolean> discount(long productId, float discountRate);
}
```

You can also try out the ability to define queries annotatively,

```
@Repository
public interface Products extends CrudRepository<Product, Long> {
    @Filter(by = "name", op = Compare.Contains)
    @Filter(by = "price", op = Compare.LessThanEqual)
    @OrderBy("price")
    List<Product> searchFor(String nameMatch, float maxPrice);

    @Filter(by = "id")
    @Update(attr = "price", op = Operation.Multiply)
    boolean adjustPrice(long productId, float ratio);

    @Delete
    @Filter(by = "name", ignoreCase = true)
    void discontinue(String productName);
}
```

Your feedback is welcome on all of the Jakarta Data features and will be helpful as the specification develops further. Let us know what you think and/or be involved directly in the specification on link:https://github.com/jakartaee/data[github].

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:
