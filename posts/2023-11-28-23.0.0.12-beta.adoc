    </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
   
    <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

Jakarta Data is a new Jakarta EE specification being developed in the open that aims to standardize the popular Data Repository pattern across a variety of providers. Open Liberty includes the Jakarta Data 1.0 Milestone 1 release, which adds the ability to annotatively compose custom life cycle methods, covering `Insert`, `Update`, `Save`, and `Delete` operations. The Open Liberty beta includes a test implementation of Jakarta Data that we are using to experiment with proposed specification features so that developers can try out these features and provide feedback to influence the Jakarta Data 1.0 specification as it continues to be developed post M1. The test implementation currently works with relational databases and operates by redirecting repository operations to the built-in Jakarta Persistence provider.

Jakarta Data 1.0 Milestone 1 introduces the concept of annotated life cycle methods. To use these methods, you will need an Entity and a Repository.

Start by defining an entity class that corresponds to your data. With relational databases, the entity class corresponds to a database table and the entity properties (public methods and fields of the entity class) generally correspond to the columns of the table. An entity class can be:

- annotated with `jakarta.persistence.Entity` and related annotations from Jakarta Persistence
- a Java class without entity annotations, in which case the primary key is inferred from an entity property named `id` or ending with `Id` and an entity property named `version` designates an automatically incremented version column.

You define one or more repository interfaces for an entity, annotate those interfaces as `@Repository` and inject them into components via `@Inject`. The Jakarta Data provider supplies the implementation of the repository interface for you.

Here's a simple entity,

```
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    public long id;

    public String name;

    public float price;

    @Version
    public long version;
}
```

Here is a repository that defines operations relating to the entity. Your repository interface can inherit from built-in interfaces such as `BasicRepository` and `CrudRepository` to gain a variety of general purpose repository methods for inserting, updating, deleting and querying for entities, but in this case we will define all of the methods ourselves, taking advantage of the new life cycle annotations.

```
@Repository(dataStore = "java:app/jdbc/my-example-data")
public interface Products {
    @Insert
    Product add(Product newProduct);

    @Update
    boolean modify(Product product);

    @Delete
    boolean remove(Product product);

    // parameter based query that requires compilation with -parameters to preserve parameter names
    Optional<Product> find(long id);

    // query-by-method name pattern:
    Page<Product> findByNameIgnoreCaseContains(String searchFor, Pageable pageRequest);

    // query via JPQL:
    @Query("UPDATE Product o SET o.price = o.price - (?2 * o.price) WHERE o.id = ?1")
    boolean discount(long productId, float discountRate);
}
```

Here is an example of the repository being used,

```
@DataSourceDefinition(name = "java:app/jdbc/my-example-data",
                      className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
                      databaseName = "ExampleDB",
                      serverName = "localhost",
                      portNumber = 5432,
                      user = "${example.database.user}",
                      password = "${example.database.password}")
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Inject
    Products products;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Insert:
        Product prod = ...
        prod = products.add(prod);

        // Update:
        prod.price = prod.price + 1.00;
        if (products.update(prod))
            System.out.println("Successfully increased the price.");
        else {
            // someone else either removed the product or updated its version before we could
            prod = products.find(productId).orElseThrow();
            ...
        }

        // Request only the first 20 results on a page, ordered by price, then name, then id:
        Pageable pageRequest = Pageable.size(20).sortBy(Sort.desc("price"), Sort.asc("name"), Sort.asc("id"));
        Page<Product> page1 = products.findByNameIgnoreCaseContains(searchFor, pageRequest);
        ...
    }
}
```

[#SUB_TAG_1]
== Configurable Quiesce Timeout


Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): 

> _Server quiesce timeout_

Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): 

> _quiesceTimeout_

</GHA-BLOG-RELATED-FEATURES>
<GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
</GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>


> _Developers or operators who experience problems when shutting down the server because the server does not wait long enough time for services to complete existing requests._

<GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.


> _Liberty has a quiesce stage when shutting down the server, which prevents services from accepting new requests and allows time for services to process existing requests. The quiesce stage has always been a fixed 30 second time period. This quiesce time period is now configurable._

What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> _The problem is that, in some cases, the 30-second quiesce period is not long enough time for services to finish processing existing requests. The ability to increase the quiesce timeout solves this problem._

Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a server.xml snippet.

> _The quiesce timeout is configured using the new "quiesceTimeout" attribute on the "applicationManager" element in server.xml

`<applicationManager quiesceTimeout=“1m30s”/>`

>  The timeout value is a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds. The minimum quiesceTimeout value is 30 seconds. If you specify a shorter length of time, the value 30s will be used.

Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?
> Configuration of the applicationManager element is described here: link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/base?topic=configuration-applicationmanager[Application Manager (applicationManager)]_

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.12-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
