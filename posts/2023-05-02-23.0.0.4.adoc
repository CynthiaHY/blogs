[#arm64]
== ARM64 container images
Starting with the 23.0.0.3 release, Liberty makes available Red Hat Universal Based Images (UBI) for the ARM64 architecture.  That means you can now natively run your Open Liberty based container images on even more platforms, such as Apple's ARM based silicone (like their M series processors) and Amazon's AWS Graviton.  Prior to these changes, the provided container images were made available for the AMD64, PPC64LE, and S390X architectures.

We recommend using the IBM Container Registry (ICR) as it is not rate limited like Docker Hub.

For more information, reference the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[Open Liberty container images] documentation.

[#log]
== Consistently log features on server start

In previous versions of Liberty, at server start, the feature manager logged a list of added features in a `CWWKF0012I` audit message and removed features in a `CWWKF0013I` audit message. In the case of a warm start, the feature manager instead logged the entire list of installed features in the `CWWKF0012I` message:
[source, xml]
----
[AUDIT ] CWWKF0012I: The server installed the following features: [el-3.0, jsp-2.3, servlet-3.1].
----

This behavior has lead to confusion from users who expected the `CWWKF0012I` to always output the full list of enabled features. In the case where the list of features is updated in between server starts, someone might believe that previously enabled features are no longer included.

Starting with 23.0.0.4, Liberty consistently provides the full list of features that are enabled every time the server is started. It also issues messages to identify features that were added or removed since the last start.

// [#api]
// == Open Liberty API and SPI documentation
// Prior to this release, the documentation only included the Java EE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile Javadocs.  Beginning with Open Liberty 23.0.0.4, the Open Liberty documentation will now include Javadoc for the APIs and SPIs that are specific to and exposed by the Liberty runtime.  The addition of these Javadocs will make it easier leverage Liberty specific functionality in your application.

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A23004+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 23.0.0.4].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24585[Insufficient Infinispan cache creation for Liberty httpSessionCache]
+
We've discovered that the way Liberty creates cache instances with Infinispan can cause multiple applications that use the same virtual host name and context-root to share a single Cache instance, even when they're in entirely separate pods and totally unrelated to each other.
+
This behavior causes problems when objects from one app are removed even just by the other app accessing the session. For example:
+
[source, xml]
----
[ERROR ] SESN0304E: An exception occurred when reading in an object of the application data for a session from the cache. The exception is: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.ibm.gs.houston.payment.ach.ibm.forms.ACHCreditForm
[ERROR ] SESN0306E: An exception occurred when invalidating a session in the cache. The exception is: java.lang.RuntimeException: Internal Server Error
[ERROR ] SESN0304E: An exception occurred when reading in an object of the application data for a session from the cache. The exception is: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.ibm.gs.houston.payment.ach.ibm.forms.ACHCreditForm
----
+
We resolved this issue by introducing the `appInCacheName` property, which, when set to `true`, includes the application name in the corresponding cache.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24915[Server hangs at startup when enabling trace specification: com.ibm.ws.*=all]
+
When the server is started with the `com.ibm.ws.*=all` trace specification, the server hangs because the application was not loaded yet.
+
The issue has been resolved and the server no longer hangs even when a very broad trace level is set.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24804[Encrypted value for internalClientSecret within oauthProvider does not work]
+
The `internalClientSecret` and `internalClientId` parameter values within the `oauthProvider` element configuration of an OpenID Connect Server are used to generate tokens for https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/oidc-tools.html#personal[Personal Token Management] and https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/oidc-tools.html#users[Users Token Management] UI pages. However, if the `internalClientSecret` value is encrypted by the  https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/command/securityUtility-commands.html[`securityUtility` command], the two UI pages no longer work. This is caused by an error that states the `ClientId` and `Secret` are invalid.
+
This issue has been resolved by adding support for encrypting the `internalClientSecret` value.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24793[JSP Options to pick up web-ext jsp-attribute values on start up (honor disableTldSearch to improve app start up time)]
+
The JSP Engine does not pick up the `jsp-attributes` during the initial stage of application startup when set by `ibm-web-ext.xml` or  `server.xml` files.   However, later phases of the start up did pick up the `jsp-attributes`. 
+
This inadvertently slowed application startup because `disableTldSearch` (which defaults to `true`) was not registered when set to `false` and so the JSP Engine continued its time-consuming search for TLDs in the various application libraries and other locations. 
+
The issue has been resolved and the JSP Engine now honors the `jsp-attributes` when they are set by `ibm-web-ext.xml` or `server.xml` files.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24683[Port MYFACES-4594]
+
MYFACES-4594 was opened because `org.apache.myfaces.LOG_WEB_CONTEXT_PARAMS` defaults to `dev-only`, which is defined in https://myfaces.apache.org/#/core40[Apache MyFaces Core 4.0] and states the following:
+
[source]
----
Indicate if info logging all web config params should be done before initializing the webapp. With 4.0.0, the default changed from auto to dev-only. where logging no longer occurs in the production project stage (new default behavior). True enables logging in the production and development project stages. False disables logging.
----
+
If multiple applications are deployed on a server and not all of them have the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.0/apidocs/jakarta/faces/application/projectstage#PROJECT_STAGE_PARAM_NAME[ProjectStage] set to `Development`, the context parameters might not work correctly for all the applications. The first application to start would define the logging that would or wouldn't take place.
+
This issue has been resolved and each application is now able to define whether context parameters are logged or not. 

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24469[Java 11 NoSuchAlgorithmException SHA1PRNG when FIPS enabled TS012071744]
+
When one enables the FIPS feature with the IBM Semeru JDK and the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/openidConnectClient.html[OpenID Connect Client] feature, the following FFDC exception is emitted:
+
[source, xml]
----

----
+
The issue has been resolved and the `SHA1PRNG` secure random algorithm is used and no FFDC exception occurs.
