= Jakarta EE with Liberty Tools for Eclipse IDE
Adam Wisniewski <https://github.com/awisniew90>

Since link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/08/01/liberty-tools-eclipse.html[introducing Liberty Tools for Eclipse IDE] in August, we've continued to add new features with each new early release. 
Currently at link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/releases/tag/liberty-tools-0.4.0[version 0.4], Liberty Tools now supports developing Jakarta EE applications and editing Liberty's `bootstrap.properties` and `server.env` files.

Let's take a closer look.

== Jakarta EE development

Integration with the Eclipse Language Server for Jakarta EE (Eclipse LSP4Jakarta) helps you intuitively develop with link:https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE]. Features such as autocompletion, quick-fixes and type-ahead seamlessly integrate into your day-to-day development, making it easy to find the right methods and annotations for your application.

Additionally, pre-configured annotations, methods and even full classes can be added to your application automatically with code snippets. These snippets get you up and running fast without having to worry about syntax, annotations or referencing example code.

== Editing Liberty server config

Liberty Tools now supports config assist and auto-completion when you edit `bootstrap.properties` and `server.env` files. You can easily look up the properties and values you need without leaving your IDE.
