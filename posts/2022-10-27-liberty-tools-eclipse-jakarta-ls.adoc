= Jakarta EE with Liberty Tools for Eclipse
Adam Wisniewski <https://github.com/awisniew90>

Since link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/08/01/liberty-tools-eclipse.html[introducing Liberty Tools for Eclipse] in August, we've continued to add new features with each new early release. 
Currently at link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/releases/tag/liberty-tools-0.4.0[version 0.4], Liberty Tools now supports developing Jakarta EE applications and editing Liberty's `bootstrap.properties` and `server.env` files.

Let's take a closer look.

== Jakarta EE development

Integration with the Eclipse Language Server for Jakarta EE (Eclipse LSP4Jakarta) allows users to intuitively develop with link:https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE]. Features such as autocompletion, quick-fixes and type-ahead seamlessly integrate into your day-to-day development making it easy to find the right methods and annotations for your application.

Additionally, full code snippets make development quick and easy.

== Editing Liberty server config

Liberty Tools now supports config assist and auto-completion when editing `bootstrap.properties` and `server.env`. You can easily look up which properties you need as well as their values without having to leave your IDE.
