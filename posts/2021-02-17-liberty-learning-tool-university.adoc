University students are the next generation of software engineers. They need opportunities to experience real-life scenarios of building applications for clients, with tools that are used in today's applications. Such experiences provide students with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the end-to-end process of creating an application and help them develop critical and practical skills for their future careers.

IBM developers recently worked with the professors at https://ww1.oswego.edu/[SUNY Oswego] to create a 15-week project students to create a web-application by using Open Liberty, MicroProfile, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This  helped students learn hands-on skills of delivering software for a client with open source tools and technologies. During this assignment, students were also taught methodologies like IBM Design Thinking and agile scrum.

Using Open Liberty in this project, the students built a successful microservice-based application in a short time. The https://www.openliberty.io/guides/[interactive guides on the Open Liberty site] were important teaching tools for the students to solve specific technical challenges in building an app like this from scratch. The project also helped the students gain an appreciation for open source tools and how they can help contribute to these tools through open collaboration with the community.

The students not only enjoyed the project, they learned many new skills and created an important network of connections to working professionals in the industry. You can check out https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaboration-excitement-between-suny-oswego-ibm-danielle-larosa[the article the students wrote] on their perspective of the project.

From an IBM perspective, the project helped us gain interesting and helpful feedback from the students on our Open Liberty guides and documentation.
