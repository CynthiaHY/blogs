== A Very Early Preview of Jakarta Data (23.0.0.7 beta)

1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to? 
    
    Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): 
Jakarta Data
    Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0):  
data-1.0
   
    </GHA-BLOG-RELATED-FEATURES>

    <GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.  
    Application developer
    
    </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
   
    <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?  
    
Jakarta Data is a new Jakarta EE specification being developed in the open that aims to standardize the popular Data Repository pattern across a variety of providers. Open Liberty includes the Jakarta Data 1.0 beta 2 release, which includes functionality such as query-by-method name, sorting and pagination, interoperability with entity classes from Jakarta Persistence, interoperability with Jakarta Transactions, and more.  The Open Liberty beta includes a test implementation of Jakarta Data that we are using to experiment with proposed specification features so that developers can try out these features and provide feedback to influence the specification as it is being developed. The test implementation currently works with relational databases and operates by redirecting repository operations to the built-in Jakarta Persistence provider. In preparation for Jakarta EE 11, which will require a minimum of Java 21 (not yet available), it runs on Java 17 and simulates the entirety of the Jakarta Data beta 2 release, plus some additional proposed features that are being considered.

To use Jakarta Data, you start by defining an entity class that corresponds to your data. With relational databases, the entity class corresponds to a database table and the entity properties (public methods and fields of the entity class) generally correspond to the columns of the table. An entity class can be:

- annotated with `jakarta.persistence.Entity` and related annotations from Jakarta Persistence
- a Java class without entity annotations, in which case the primary key is inferred from an entity property named `id` or ending with `Id`.

You define one or more repository interfaces for an entity, annotate those interfaces as `@Repository` and inject them into components via CDI. The Jakarta Data provider supplies the implementation of the repository interface for you.

Here's a simple entity, repository, and usage of it.

```
public class Product { // entity
    public long id;
    public String name;
    public float price;
}

@Repository
public interface Products extends CrudRepository<Product, Long> {
    // query-by-method name pattern:
    Page<Product> findByNameIgnoreCaseContains(String searchFor, Pageable pageRequest);

    // query via JPQL:
    @Query("UPDATE Product o SET o.price = o.price - (?2 * o.price) WHERE o.id = ?1")
    boolean discount(long productId, float discountRate);

    // experimental annotatively-defined query (not part of Jakarta Data 1.0)
    @Filter(by = "productId")
    @Update(attr = "price", op = Operation.Add)
    boolean increasePrice(long prodId, float amount);
}

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Inject
    Products products;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Request only the first 20 results on a page, ordered by price, then name, then id:
        Pageable pageRequest = Pageable.size(20).sortBy(Sort.desc("price"), Sort.asc("name"), Sort.asc("id"));
        Page<Product> page1 = products.findByNameIgnoreCaseContains(searchFor, pageRequest);
    }
}
```

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.7-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
