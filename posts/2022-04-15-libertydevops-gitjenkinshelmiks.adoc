[#Intro]

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) is a process in which developers frequently merge code changes into a source code repository, which then automatically builds the code, runs security scans, runs tests, and then deploys the application. Automation of this process, through adopting a DevOps culture, tools, and processes, enables organizations to release on a more frequent basis without compromising on quality. There are various tools available to automate the CI/CD process that can be readily integrated into a DevOps deployment pipeline. In this blog post we'll discuss how you can use Jenkins to automate the CI/CD process for building, testing, and deploying your cloud-native Java applications running on link:https://openliberty.io[Open Liberty].

Jenkins is a popular open source automation server that has hundreds of plugins to help integrate it into your existing DevOps pipeline. The following diagram shows a simple architecture for a Jenkins deployment pipeline that builds and deploys a Jakarta EE and MicroProfile application in a single Kubernetes environment. When a code change in the Git repository is detected by Jenkins, Jenkins builds the code, runs Junit unit tests and then SonarQube security and static analysis scans against the built code. Jenkins then generates a Docker (container) image of the application with Open Liberty as its runtime, scans the image with Trivy, and saves the image to a Docker repository. Jenkins then triggers a deployment using CLI commands and deploys the Docker image to Kubernetes.

In this blog post, I will assume that you have a basic understanding of Git, Docker, Kubernetes. I will also assume that the Jakarta EE and MicroProfile application code is stored in link:https://github.com/[Github]. I will use link:https://hub.docker.com/[DockerHub] to store the Docker images and I will deploy the containerized application to link:https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create[IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service].

== Installing and configuring Jenkins to set up CI/CD of a cloud-native Java application

Install link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/[Jenkins] with the following plugins on the base image of your Jenkins container image, or on the Jenkins master.

* Maven, to build java code
* Pipeline, for creating Jenkins pipeline jobs
* Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger, to create Jenkins pipeline type jobs which pull all branches of code from Git to Jenkins
* Docker or equivalent like [Podman](https://podman.io), to build and push container images
* Kubernetes, to use the Kubernetes template

Jenkins builds your Java application code running on Liberty using Jenkins pipeline scripts. The script can run directly on your Jenkins installation (known as Jenkins master) but, if the application is big, you need to use a Jenkins agent. For more information about about setting up Jenkins agents, see link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/[Using Jenkins agents] and link:[https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/Pipeline Syntax].

== Writing Jenkins pipeline scripts

It is good practice to adhere to the concept of infrastructure as a code (IaaC) when writing DevOps pipelines. Writing Jenkins jobs as pipeline scripts is a good example of IaaC.

You can write link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Jenkins pipeline code] in one of the following ways:

* As pipeline code written directly in the link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/[Jenkins UI] and stored in the Jenkins master. This is a useful way to get started. You would need to take a backup of the Jenkins instance to store the pipeline code because it is part of the Jenkins installation. 

[.imageblock.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/pipeline-code-on-jenkins.png[Pipeline code directly on Jenkins,width=70%,align="center"]

* As plain text in a Jenkinsfile (a plain text file) in Git and mapping it to Jenkins. This is better for ensuring that your configuration is always under version control. If you have specific build and deployment configurations for separate environments, such as dev, staging, and production, you create a separate Jenkinsfile for each environment and store it in that environment-specific Git repository branches. You can use either the "Pipeline" or "Multibranch pipeline" type of job in this case.

== Building the cloud-native Java application with Open Liberty on Jenkins

Build your Dockerfile from the foundation code given below. Additional files mentioned in the code can be downloaded from link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-devops-assets/blob/main/featureUtility.properties[featureUtility.properties] , link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-devops-assets/blob/main/server.xml[server.xml]

The following sample pipeline code builds your Java application code, packages it into a Docker container image, and pushes the Docker image to a remote container image repository, such as Docker Hub or an equivalent within your enterprise:

[source]
----
 pipeline {
     agent any
      stages {
       stage('Build') {
                    steps {
              checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/main']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: ‘<git token>, url: 'https://github.com/liberty/app.git']]])
                    sh '''
                         mvn -U package
                         docker login <remote-docker-image-repository-url> -u "${USERNAME}" -p “${PASSWORD}”
                         docker build -t liberty-$<code identifier>:$<docker image version> .
                         #eg: docker build -t liberty-app:v1.0 .
                         docker tag liberty-$<code identifier>:$<docker image version> <remote-docker-image-repository-url>/<docker-repo-name>/liberty-$<code identifier>:$<docker image version>
                         #eg: docker tag liberty-app:v1.0 docker.io/someid/liberty-app:v1.0
                         docker push <remote-docker-image-repository-url>/<docker-repo-name>/liberty-$<code identifier>:$<docker image version>
                         #eg: docker push docker.io/someid/liberty-app:v1.0  
                       '''   
                  }
               }
            }
          }
----

Where:

* _git-token_ is the personal access token you have generated from your Github account.
* _remote-docker-image-repository-url_ is the location of the Docker image repository.
* _username_ is your user name for the Docker image repository.
* _password_ is your password for the Docker image repository.
* _docker-image-version_ is the version number of your Docker image, a unique identifier.

For static code analysis, you can use SonarQube Community edition. SonarQube's Jenkins client setup details are given at link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-jenkins/[SonarScanner for Jenkins]. The following Maven command packages the code with Maven and runs the SonarQube scan:

[source]
----
mvn package verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=sampleapp -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 -Dsonar.login=7b13f240123456780479b13d09ba8
----

For Docker image scanning, you can use link:https://hub.docker.com/r/aquasec/trivy/[Trivy]. This scan provides the vulnerability details of open source JAR files that are used in the application. The following Docker command runs Trivy against your Docker image:

[source]
----
docker run aquasec/trivy image docker.io/<docker-repo>/liberty-app:v1.0
----

Where:

* _docker-repo_ is the name of the Docker repository that contains your image

== Deploying cloud-native Java applications with Open Liberty to Kubernetes with Jenkins

For simplicity, I will use the command line (CLI) option to configure Jenkins to deploy a Jakarta EE and MicroProfile application with Open Liberty to Kubernetes. You could use one of many tools though, such as Helm, Travis CI, Circle CI, etc.

In your pipeline code, add these CLI commands in a new stage. The following sample pipeline code connects to IBM Cloud from CLI and then connects to Kubernetes cluster running inside that, further it runs all the Kubernetes deployment related configurations .
                           
[source]
----
ibmcloud login --apikey $IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY -g $IBM_CLOUD_RSGRP
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $CLUSTER-ID
kubectl config current-context
kubectl create -f deploy/deployment.yaml #( simple k8s deployment command )
kubectl create -f deploy/service.yaml #( simple k8s deployment command )
kubectl create -f deploy/route.yaml #( simple k8s deployment command )
----

Make sure that your Kubernetes configuration files are stored in the same git repository as your Jenkinsfile in a sub-directory called `deploy`. Also ensure that the Docker image name in the Kubernetes deployment configuration file updated manually (or programmatically, if it needs to change at run time):

[.imageblock.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/deploymentyaml.png[Image reference in deployment yaml,width=40%,align="center"]

When Jenkins has checked out the Java application code for the code build, all the Kubernetes configuration files are also downloaded to the Jenkins workspace so that Jenkins can run the IBM Cloud and Kubernetes commands to connect to the Kubernetes cluster and deploy the application.

See the Kubernetes documentation for other commands:
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/[kubectl Cheat Sheet].

== QA testing cloud-native Java applications with Jenkins

Apart from running JUnit test cases along with the code build phase, Jenkins can trigger functional and integration QA test cases automatically after deploying the cloud-native Java application.

Configure the test cases in the Jenkins job and test it manually. Create a remote job identifier authentication token in the "Trigger builds remotely" section under "Build Triggers". Trigger this test case from the Docker "entrypoint" file by using remote rest API call that uses this authentication token as the identifier.

For example, run the following command in a terminal: 

[source]
----
curl -I -u <auth-token> https://<jenkins-host>/job/<job-name>/build?token=<remote-job-identifier-authentication-token>
----

You can generate an authentication token (auth-token) with link:https://www.postman.com[Postman] using the Jenkins login credentials.

== Kubernetes monitoring tools

Kubernetes provides commands to check the application or cluster logs and memory and CPU usage through the commands like: 

[source]
----
kubectl logs ..
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpuacct.usage (after connecting to k8s pod)
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes (after connecting to k8s pod)
----

There are several applications available that you can integrate with Kubernetes to persist logs and usage statistics, such as link:https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Grafana] and link:https://prometheus.io[Prometheus]. You can read more in the following articles:

* link:https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/logging-at-scale-in-kubernetes-using-grafana-loki-3bb2eb0c0872[Grafana with Loki]

* link:https://k21academy.com/docker-kubernetes/prometheus-grafana-monitoring/[Prometheus setup in Kubernetes]

These tools are deployed in the Kubernetes cluster where the application is running and exposed by using route and access the gathered details from UI.


== Conclusion
There are many ways in which you can configure your DevOps pipeline. This blog post is a quick introduction to how you can use Jenkins to set up a simple CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy your cloud-native Java applications on Liberty.
