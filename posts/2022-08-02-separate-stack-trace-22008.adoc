[#stack_trace]
=== Stack trace separated from logged messages in logging records

The stack trace is now separated from logged messages in logging records so that log analysis tools can present them more clearly. This makes visualizations of the logs by downstream log analysis tools easier to read when you are identifying any issues encountered by the application. Previously, any logging record originating from a Java Logger object that made use of any of the methods that accept a `Throwable` parameter would simply append the stack trace to the existing `message` field. Keeping the `message` field solely for the logged message and having a separate field for the stack trace and exception type enhances the effectiveness of log analysis tools down stream.

Java's link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html[Logging API] provides methods that allow you to include a `Throwable` as a parameter. When the `Throwable` object is used, Open Liberty's JSON logging provides two new fields, `ibm_stackTrace` and `ibm_exceptionName`, and the Open Liberty link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/logstashCollector-1.0.html[Logstash Collector] feature provides two new fields, `stackTrace` and `exceptionName`. The stack trace fields present only the stack trace of the `Throwable` object. The exception name fields present the type of exception of the `Throwable` object.

*Example:*

For the example we will only be showing the message log record for Open Liberty's JSON logging.

Application with the following code snippet:
[source, java]
----
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyResource.class.getCanonicalName());
Exception exception = new IllegalArgumentException("ouch");
logger.log(Level.INFO, "exception message", exception);
----

Previous Open Liberty JSON logging output:

[source, json]
----
{
    "type": "liberty_message",
    ...
    "message": “exception message  java.lang.RuntimeException: ouch\r\n\tatmy.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:32)\r\n\tatmy.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:20)\r\n...",
    ...
}
----

New Open Liberty JSON logging output:

[source, json]
----
{
    "type": "liberty_message",
    ...
    "message": “exception message",
    "ibm_exceptionName":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException",
    "ibm_stackTrace":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ouch\r\n\tat my.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:20)\r\n...",
    ...
}

[#log_rollover]
== Time-based log rollover for Liberty

Liberty provides a few different log files; a `message.log` is created by default, and a `trace.log` and `http_access.log` can be enabled for tracing and `NCSA` access logs respectively. Previously, these log files could be rolled over only by either server restart or by limiting the maximum log file size with the `maxFileSize` logging attribute. Instead of file size-based log rollover, users may want to roll over their files at periodic times to facilitate their existing log cleaning or archival processes. 

Now, you can enable time-based periodic rollover of those log files at their own specified time of day by using two new optional logging configuration attributes: `rolloverInterval` and `rolloverStartTime`. Upon roll over, the file names are appended with a timestamp that corresponds to the time that the log was rolled over.

* `rolloverInterval` is the desired time interval between log rollovers. Set the attribute with a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be days (d), hours (h), or minutes (m). For example, specify 5 hours as `5h``. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, `1d5h`` is equivalent to 1 day and 5 hours.

* `rolloverStartTime` is the time of day when logs first roll over and the first rollover interval duration begins. Valid values for this attribute follow a 24-hour ISO-8601 time format of HH:MM, where 00:00 represents midnight. 

The two configuration attributes are optional. If neither of the attributes are set, then time-based log rollover is not enabled. If only one of the two attributes is set, then time-based log rollover is enabled, and the other attribute is set to its default. The default value for `rolloverInterval` is `1d`, and the default value for `rolloverStartTime` is `00:00`.

Example `server.xml` file configuration for log rollover in the `messages.log` and `trace.log` files by specifying the new attributes in the `logging` element:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
   ...
    <logging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d"/>
    ...
</server>
----

Example `server.xml` file configuration for log rollover in the `http_access.log` file by specifying the new attributes in the `httpAccessLogging` element:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
   ...
    <httpAccessLogging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d" logFormat='%h %u %{t}W "%r" %s %b' />
    ...
</server>
----

Example `server.xml` configuration for access logging, using `<accessLogging/>` under `<httpEndpoint/>`, which handles `http_access.log` rollover:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
   ...
   <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint">
      <accessLogging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d" logFormat='%h %i %u %t "%r" %s %b' />
   </httpEndpoint>
    ...
</server>
----

Example result of logs, rolled over every minute, with a configuration of `rolloverInterval="1m"` and `rolloverStartTime="00:00"`:

[#jaxws]
== jaxws-2.2 updates to CXF 3.4

We've updated `jaxws-2.2` to use CXF 3.4, which is a huge update coming all way up from CXF 2.6.2. Anyone using `jaxws-2.2` will automatically get the update with 22.0.0.8, and you shouldn't see any behavioral changes with this update. On our end, it does make it much easier to keep `jaxws-2.2` up-to-date going forward, and you will see a much quicker turn around time on pulling in the latest fixes from CXF and it's related dependencies going forward!

== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A22.0.0.8_NO_PERIODS+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.8].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21526[UI generated by openapi-3.1 feature doesn't show the link specific endpoints]
+
An issue arose when you clicked an endpoint in the UI that is generated by the `openapi-3.1 feature`, the clicked endpoint is expanded however the URL of the browser is not changed. As the result, you could not pass a link to a specific endpoint to others for reference. The URL of the browser is expected to change to show the link to the clicked endpoint.
+
This was not a problem and used to work in the UI that is generated by the `apiDiscovery-1.0` feature and also works in the `petstore` demo UI that can be found link:https://petstore.swagger.io/#/pet/addPet[here].
+
The links below shows the issue at hand:

This issue has since been reviewed and subsequently the affected features list have been updated once the UI is shared with the `mpOpenApi` features. This did previously work for openapi-3.1 but had been broken by link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/19535[#19535] in 22.0.0.2. This issue has now been resolved. 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21214[Server start fails when directory has spaces]
+ 
When the server working directory is specified using environment variable SERVER_WORKING_DIR, and when a space is present in the name of the server working directory, an attempt to start the server using the Windows server script will hang, and the server will not start. 
+
Steps to Reproduce are as follows:
+
On Windows, set the server working directory using environment variable SERVER_WORKING_DIR with a directory name which contains a space. Then attempt to start the server using the server script `(server.bat)`.
+
Note that this occurs on Windows only, Diagnostic information can be found below:
+
OpenLiberty Versions: 21.0.0.6 and higher.
Affected feature(s): All
Java Version: All
WINDOWS ONLY
+
Additional Context for this issue can be found below:
+
A work-around is available as the problem occurs because of an error in the server script "WLP_HOME/bin/server.bat".
+
Quotes are missing near line 721:
+
The line:
`if x%SERVER_WORKING_DIR::=%==x%SERVER_WORKING_DIR% (`
+
Should instead be:
`if "%SERVER_WORKING_DIR::=%"=="%SERVER_WORKING_DIR%" (`
+
A step of removing double quotes from SERVER_WORKING_DIR is missing near line 103.
+
The line:
`if defined WLP_OUTPUT_DIR set WLP_OUTPUT_DIR=!WLP_OUTPUT_DIR:"=!`
+
Should be followed by the (completely new) line:
+
`if defined SERVER_WORKING_DIR set SERVER_WORKING_DIR=!SERVER_WORKING_DIR:"=!`
+
These two changes (updating one line; adding one completely new line) may be used to work-around the problem.
+
The problem was introduced by the Pull Request:
+
"JVM Working Directory Feature"
#18931
73b51bb
+
Integrated into "gm-22.0.0.6-beta" on 22-Nov-2021.
+
The Pull Request is for the Issue:
+
"Add support for setting JVM working dir"
#15128
+
This is not a regression: The problem occurs relative to environment variable SERVER_WORKING_DIR, which was added by the issue 15128.
+
This issue was identified as a work bug and worked on by the Open Liberty Kernal Team which has since been resolved. You can find out more information about this fix of adding quotes to server working directory test link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21234[here].


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21601[Port MYFACES-4432 to JSF 2.3 and Faces 3.0 (Resolve request object in facelets)]
+
The issue occured when using the `"@FacesConfig"` annotation in a JSF 2.3 or Faces 3.0 application, the `#{request}` object fails to resolve. An empty string is returned instead. 
+
In order to reporduce the steps; Use @FacesConfig in the 2.3 or 3.0 application, and reference request in a facelet.
+
The object should resolve, so that any of it's methods can be called. See table 5-11 of the JSF 2.3 spec for all objects which should be resolved.
+ 
Diagnostic information can be found below: 
+
OpenLiberty Version: All versions
Affected feature(s) jsf-2.3, faces-3.0
Java Version: N/A
+ 
Additonal context can be found below:
+
Note: The implicit request and session objects are resolved via JSF's `ImplicitObjectResolver` not CDI. This is so that HttpServletRequest and HttpSession are not made injectable by JSF (i.e.. JSF should not use the Producer annotation in the implementation for HttpServletRequest and HttpSession). 
+
CDI should directly manage the injectablility of these objects instead. See the the discussion link:https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/issues/1564[here on GitHub] and link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MYFACES/issues/MYFACES-4432[here on Apache] for reference.
+
This issue has now been closed as completed in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21599[#21599]


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21615[EJB persistent timers that were deferred during app start do not run when app finishes starting]
+
EJB Persistent Timers that get deferred due to the application not being started yet do not run after the application finishes starting.
+
Steps to reproduce are to have a large, slowly-starting application with a number of persistent EJB timers around from a previous run. Start the server and if timing is right, the timers will never start running.
+
The expected behavior is for EJB persistent timers that were deferred due to an unavailable application, should run after the application becomes available again.
+
The diagnostic information is as follows:
+
OpenLiberty Version: unknown - 22.0.0.7
Affected feature(s) ejbPersistentTimer-3.2, enterpriseBeansPersistentTimer-4.0
Java Version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0.7.5 - pmz6480sr7fp5-20220208_01(SR7 FP5))
+
To understand the issue better, below is a breakdown of the process to which the error occurs:
+
Timers are first put into a queue because they attempt to start while the server config is still being processed,

----
+
An assumption was that ApplicationTracker.addStartedApplication doesn't see any timers to run because ApplicationTracker.deferTask wasn't ever invoked for the tasks. There is no evidence in the trace of deferTask being invoked.
+
There is only one place in the code where the `deferTask` can be invoked:
+ 
[source, java]
----
                    } else if (ownerForDeferredTask != null)
                        appTracker.deferTask(this, ownerForDeferredTask, persistentExecutor);
----
+
It requires a non-null `ownerForDeferredTask`.
+
There are two places (both in the same method) where `ownerForDeferredTask` is assigned,
+
[source, java]
----
                    } else if (ownerForDeferredTask != null)
                        appTracker.deferTask(this, ownerForDeferredTask, persistentExecutor);
----
+
[source, java]
----
            if (loader == null || !appTracker.isStarted(owner)) {
                ownerForDeferredTask = owner;
                if (trace && tc.isEntryEnabled())
                    Tr.exit(this, tc, "run[" + taskId + ']', "unavailable - deferred");
                return; // Ignore, we are deferring the task because the application or module is unavailable
            }
----
+
As presented in the code, the return statment from both of those if blocks. It prevents code flow from continuing, meaning that appTracker.deferTask is unreachable.
+
This issue has now had a fix to run deferred tasks after the app starts in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21616[#21616] and has subsequently now been closed. 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21664[featureUpdate downloads fail in Windows, due to #20945]
+
The issue is that you are unable to connect to Maven repo on Windows due to changes made in #20945. There is a need to append backsplash instead of File.separator for urls.
+
The steps to reproduce this follows:

[source, role="no_copy"]

featureUtility.exe installFeature or featureUtility.exe installServerFeature
