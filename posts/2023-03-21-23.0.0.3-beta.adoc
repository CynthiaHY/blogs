//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
// Do not remove or edit the variables on the lines beneath the author name.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present an image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to

// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace mbroz2 with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace Michal Broz with your name as you'd like it to be displayed,

// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

BETA_RELEASE_SUMMARY

// Change the RELEASE_SUMMARY to an introductory paragraph. This sentence is really

// Throughout the doc, replace 23.0.0.3-beta with the version number of Open Liberty, eg: 22.0.0.2-beta

The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 23.0.0.3-beta includes the following beta features (along with link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features]):

* <<SUB_TAG_0, Support for JDK 20>>

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Change SUB_FEATURE_TITLE to the feature that is included in this release and

By taking advantage of trying out the new changes in Java 20 now, you get more time to review your applications, microservices and runtime environments and be a step ahead when it becomes generally available.

To give this a try today, link:https://jdk.java.net/20/[download the early access release of Java 20], download and install the link:https://openliberty.io/downloads/#runtime_betas[23.0.0.3-beta] version of Open Liberty, edit your Liberty server's link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html#server-env[server.env file] to point JAVA_HOME to your Java 20 installation and start testing!

For more information on Java 20, please visit the Java 20 link:https://jdk.java.net/20/release-notes[release notes page], link:https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk20/docs/api/[API Javadoc page] or link:https://jdk.java.net/20/[download page].
For more information on Open Liberty, please visit our link:https://openliberty.io/docs[documentation page].

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.3-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.3-beta,)'
}
