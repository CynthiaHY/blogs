* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23017[MP Reactive Messaging: NullPointerException during Kafka partition rebalance]
+
During partition reassignment, it's possible for the Kafka connector for MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to not update its internal state correctly, resulting in it no longer receiving messages and a `NullPointerException` being logged.
+
The following log messages may be seen:
+
[source]
----
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at com.ibm.ws.microprofile.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaInput.lambda$wrapInMessageStream$10(KafkaInput.java:274)

	at org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator.invokePartitionsRevoked(ConsumerCoordinator.java:315)
----
+
This issue has been resolved and the partition assignment succeeds correctly and without these errors.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21808[Provide a way for Custom User Registries to use the uniqueId instead of the securityName]
+
When using a `CustomUserRegistry` and making a programmatic API call like `getRemoteUser`, `getCallerPrincipal` or `getUserPrincipal`, Open Liberty was incorrectly returning the `securityName`.
+
The issue is now resolved and the `getRemoteUser`, `getCallerPrincipal` or `getUserPrincipal` methods correctly return the `displayName`.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23252[AmbiguousResolutionException when same class is present twice and certain features are used]
+
When a class is present twice in an application and is used as a CDI managed bean and certain features are used, CDI may sometimes report an `AmbiguousResolutionException`.
+
[source]
----
Caused by: org.jboss.weld.exceptions.AmbiguousResolutionException: WELD-001318: Cannot resolve an ambiguous dependency between: 
  - Managed Bean [class com.ibm.wssvt.acme.annuity.common.business.jaxrs.MyJAXBResolver] with qualifiers [@Any @Default],
  - Managed Bean [class com.ibm.wssvt.acme.annuity.common.business.jaxrs.MyJAXBResolver] with qualifiers [@Any @Default]
----
+
This issue is now resolved.  The same bean is no longer included twice and the exception is no longer thrown.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23225[IllegalStateException in DynaCache when app server is stopping]
+
Sometimes while the Liberty server is shutting down with the `webCache-1.0` feature enabled, an FFDC is created by a DynaCache daemon thread:
+
[source]
----
Stack Dump = java.lang.IllegalStateException: ScheduledExecutorService service is unavailable
 at com.ibm.ws.cache.Scheduler.getScheduledExecutorService(Scheduler.java:93)
 at com.ibm.ws.cache.Scheduler.createNonDeferrable(Scheduler.java:108)

 at com.ibm.ws.cache.Scheduler$WrappedRunnable.run(Scheduler.java:130)
 ...
----
+
The issue is now resolved.  DynaCache no longer attempts to create a schedule when the Liberty server is stopping and the FFDC is not generated.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23186[IdentityStore validate method not getting called for BasicAuthentication request]
+
Some Basic Authentication requests fail due to `IdentityStore` not being called correctly.  This a result of Liberty's `BasicHttpAuthenticationMechanism` using `BasicAuthenticationCredential` instead of `UsernamePasswordCredential`. That credential object is passed down to the `IdentityStore` `validate` method call as a parameter.
+
The `BasicAuthenticationCredential` class extends the `UsernamePasswordCredential`.
+
For this case, `IdentityStore` needs to have an overloaded version of the `validate` method to function properly.  For example:
+
[source]
----
public CredentialValidationResult validate(BasicAuthenticationCredential basicAuthenticationCredential) {
        return validate(new UsernamePasswordCredential(basicAuthenticationCredential.getCaller(), basicAuthenticationCredential.getPasswordAsString()));
    }
----
+
The issue is now resolved and the authentication succeeds with the `validate` method being called and successfully validating the user.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/23183[EJB Handle deserialization fails with org.omg.CORBA.TRANSIENT: attempt to establish connection failed]
+
After deserializing an `EJBHandle` or `HomeHandle`, attempts to use the handle may fail with the following exception:
+
[source]
----

----
+
This issue is now resolved and the method calls on the EJB (or EJBHome) work properly.

After changing the `server.xml` to add features to the `featureManager` list, the server can fail to start with `Uses constraint violation` errors related to `org.joda.time` packages.

This issue is now resolved and the server starts successfully without the error.

+
As a result of updating CXF, a bug has been re-introduced that causes a valid SOAP request to fail when UsernameToken does not include milliseconds. 
+
This issue has been resolved, and a test has been added to help ensure the regression doesn't occur again.

This issue is now resolved and all references to applications classes are released when an application is stopped.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22865[Datasource changes are not propagating to JPA during dynamic config update]
+
When updating the `<datasource>` properties (`databaseName`, `password`, `portNumber`, `serverName`, etc.) in the `server.xml` file while the server is running, the changes are not reflected in JPA applications.
+
During server start, JPA Container does a JNDI lookup for the DataSource and provides that DataSource to the JPA provider, EclipseLink. After the configuration update fires, EclipseLink continues using the same DataSource that JPA Container provided. The DataSourceService isn't closing the ConnectionFactory, so everything continues to work. For JPA, the application needs to be restarted in order for this to work, however the DataSourceService is not refreshing the application.
+
This issue has been resolved and JPA applications are now dynamically updated when changes to the configuration occur.
