The Guides cover how to build and test the application. The containerized application will be deployed to the Kubernetes environment. 

The Guides provide Web-based editor so that the readers do not need to set up the local development environment. The cloud-native applications can be deployed on the IBM Cloud for free.

The tutorials of the Guides can be translated to non-English language using the translation tool that comes with browsers apart from the programming exercise part.
