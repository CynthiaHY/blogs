The use of microservice architecture may increase difficultly to see how services depend on or affect other services. Consequently, making it harder to find the source of latency or inaccuracy. 

One way to increase observability of an application is by emitting traces. link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile/releases/microprofile-telemetry-1.0/plan[MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0] adopts OpenTelemetry Tracing so your MicroProfile applications can benefit from both manual and automatic traces! 

* *Traces* represent requests and consist of multiple spans.
* *Spans* are representative of single operations in a request and contain a name, time-related data, log messages and metadata to give information about what occurs during a transaction.
* *Context* is an immutable object contained in the span data to identify the unique request that each span is a part of. This data is required for moving trace information across service boundaries, allowing developers to follow a single request through a potentially complex distributed system.
* *Exporters* are components that send data to a backend service so you can visualise and monitor the generated spans. 

You can export the data that MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 collects to link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] or link:https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin]. Additionally, OpenTelemetry includes a simple logging exporter, which provides an easy way to check that spans are being created by viewing the data in your console. This may be helpful for debugging.

The diagram below shows a system consisting of two services which both have applications running on Open Liberty. With MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 installed, the requests and responses generate spans and the paths between the services are monitored using their context. The spans are then exported to a dedicated backend services where they can be seen in a user interface or the console logs.

There are multiple ways that you can collect this data: Automatic Instrumentation, Manual Instrumentation and link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/[Open Telemetry's Java Agent].

We'll be using a simple demo application to show you how to collect traces from multiple services. Check out the code here: 

link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo[https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo]

Before we get started, it would be a good idea to get the backend set up. 
If you would like to use Jaeger, follow the instructions link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.39/getting-started/[here]. 
If you would rather use Zipkin, you can follow the steps link:https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart[here].

## Automatic Instrumentation

MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 allows you to observe traces without modifying source code in your Jakarta RESTful web service (aka JAX-RS) applications. 

As you can see in the `system` service, you can enable `mpTelemetry-1.0` in your link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml#L5[server.xml]: 

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpTelemetry-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

By default, MicroProfile Telemetry tracing is off. To enable any tracing aspects, specify `otel.sdk.disabled=false` as a config property or `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false` as an environment property for your server. This is enabled in the demo link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/inventoy/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties#L2[here].

For more information on these properties, see link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md[OpenTelemetry's configuration documentation].

Open a new command-line session and navigate to the `system` directory:

`cd system`

Start the `system` service: 

`mvn liberty:run`

Navigate to the system properties endpoint: 

`http://localhost:9080/system/properties`

A span for this request will be automatically created by MicroProfile Telemetry. Check for the span in the exporter's endpoint. For example: 

image::img/blog/mptelemetry_system_span.png[System span]

You have collected traces using Automatic Instrumentation! However, you might want to annotate selected methods or collect custom telemetry data. It's now time to modify source code to add more data to your spans...  

## Manual Instrumentation

The automatic instrumentation only instruments Jakarta RESTful web service applications. To get further spans on other operations, such as database calls, manual instrumentation can be added to the source code.

### Prerequisites

Before instrumenting your code, the following prerequisites are required:

* Third-party APIs must be made visibile for your application in the 
link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml#L11-L14[server.xml]: 


[source, xml]
----
<webApplication location="demo-microprofile-telemetry-inventory.war" contextRoot="/">
    <!-- enable visibility to third party apis -->
    <classloader apiTypeVisibility="+third-party"/>
</webApplication>
----

* The OpenTelemetry API and OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Annotations must be provided as dependencies to your build path. For example, with Maven, we add the following to the link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/inventory/pom.xml#L39-L47[`pom.xml`] file.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-instrumentation-annotions</artifactId>
    <version>1.19.0-alpha</version>
</dependency>
----

### Code Instrumentation

Now you are all set to instrument your code to manually create traces. We start by link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/demo/inventory/InventoryResource.java#L38-L42[`injecting a Tracer and Span`] object: 

[source, java]
----
@Inject
Tracer tracer;

@Inject
Span getPropertiesSpan;
----

This can then be used to create spans. For example, a span called `GettingProperties` starts and an event is added before the `system` service is called: 

[source,java]
----
getPropertiesSpan = tracer.spanBuilder("GettingProperties").startSpan();
Properties props = manager.get(hostname);
try(Scope scope = getPropertiesSpan.makeCurrent()){
    ...
    getPropertiesSpan.addEvent("Received properties");
}
finally{
    getPropertiesSpan.end();
}
----

You can also create new spans by annotating methods in any Jakarta CDI beans using link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/annotations/[`@WithSpan`]. link:https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/demo/inventory/InventoryManager.java#L47-L48[Here] a span is created when a new system is added to the inventory. The `hostname` method parameter is annotated with the `@SpanAttribute` annotation to indicate that it is part of the trace: 

[source, java]
----
@WithSpan
public void add(@SpanAttribute(value = "hostname") String hostname, Properties systemProps) {
    ...
}
----

A span created using the `@WithSpan` annotation can be given a name. For example, the span created link: https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy/mpTelemetry-Demo/blob/main/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/demo/inventory/InventoryManager.java#L58[here] is given the name "list":

[source,java]
----
@WithSpan("list")
public InventoryList list() {
    ...
}
----

Now that spans have been created manually, we can build the inventory service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

`cd inventory`

`mvn liberty:run`

Navigate to the inventory endpoint:

`http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost`

You should see five spans in the exporter's endpoint: four spans from inventory and one span from system. For example:

image::img/blog/mptelemetry_inventory_manual_span.png[Inventory manual span]

These spans are all part of one single trace which is emitted from the request to the endpoint above. It is therefore easier to identify the source of inaccuracy or latency in a single request by debugging spans individually.  

See link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/[OpenTelemetry's manual instrumentation documentation].

## Java Agent

The OpenTelemetry Java Agent enables Java applications to generate and capture telemetry data automatically using a JAR that can be attached to any Java 8+ application. You can make use of the Java Agent when MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 is not enabled in your `server.xml`.

You can attach the JAR by adding the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<!-- Plugin to package opentelemetry java agent -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>copy</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>copy</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <artifactItems>
            <artifactItem>
                <groupId>io.opentelemetry.javaagent</groupId>
                <artifactId>opentelemetry-javaagent</artifactId>
                <version>1.19.0</version>
                <type>jar</type>
                <outputDirectory>src/main/liberty/config</outputDirectory>
                <destFileName>opentelemetry-javaagent.jar</destFileName>
            </artifactItem>
        </artifactItems>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You can then run Maven with the `package` goal. This will copy the OpenTelemetry Java Agent in to your server config: 

`mvn package` 

add the following line to your `jvm.options` file along with the link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/[agent configuration]:

```
-javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

There are some limitations of using the agent to trace services:

### Configuration

* Configuration is shared between all applications deployed to the server. 
* Configuration properties are not read using MicroProfile Config and instead are only read from system properties and environment variables. 
* The agent reads its configuration very early in the startup process so system properties are not read from `bootstrap.properties`. 

### SPI extensions
* link:https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure-spi/1.19.0/index.html[SPI-Extensions] within applications will be ignored. See the link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/#extensions[agent documentation] for providing SPI extensions.

### Annotations
* The agent instruments rest calls and methods annotated with `@WithSpan`. Therefore, the created spans may be slightly different to those you would see with MicroProfile Telemetry's manual instrumentation.

### Library Instrumentation
* Open Liberty uses many open source libraries internally. Some of these may be instrumented automatically by the agent.

The agent creates and configures a global OpenTelemetry object using link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation#configuring-the-agent[environment variables and system properties]. Therefore, configuration is not read from link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-config-properties.html[MicroProfile Config].
