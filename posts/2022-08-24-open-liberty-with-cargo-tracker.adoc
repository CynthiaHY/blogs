As one of the top Java framework choices for enterprise-level applications, Jakarta EE can be found at the center of projects all over the globe. The https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/cargotracker/[Cargo Tracker] open-source application was designed to replicate a complex enterprise application by utilizing core Jakarta EE features with professional development standards. Now, you can get a taste of Open Liberty in an industry environment by running Cargo Tracker with an Open Liberty server all on your own computer. 

== The Cargo Tracker application

Cargo Tracker simulates an industry-developed freight tracking web application built with Jakarta EE 8 and domain-driven design principles. The application uses multiple key Jakarta EE features, including Faces, CDI, enterprise beans, bean validation, REST, and JSON binding. Persistence is also implemented along with batching and JMS messaging. 

Functionally, the application is set up to book, track, update, and route cargo objects. Messaging events are logged to update cargo locations while persistence ensures that cargo status is not changed or removed when the application is shut down. Each portion of Cargo Tracker represents a step in a real-life shipment process: the customer tracks their cargo using the Public Tracking interface, the shipping company schedules and routes deliveries using the Administration interface, and handlers in ports log arriving and departing cargo using the Mobile Event Logger.

Cargo Tracker was originally developed to work with the Payara runtime and had not been previously used with Open Liberty, but the application's functionality was perfectly preserved after the server switch. There were no issues across operating systems, as Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 10, and Mac OS Monterey 12.4 were all able to run Cargo Tracker identically.

== Running Cargo Tracker with Open Liberty yourself

Feel free to give Cargo Tracker with Open Liberty a try on your own! Cargo Tracker supports Java SE 8, 11, and 17 â€” https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads[IBM Semeru Runtime] is preferred when using Open Liberty. Before cloning the application to your machine, install any required JDKs and make sure that your JAVA_HOME is compatible. To access the repository remotely you'll need to install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git] if you haven't already. Finally, you will need to install https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] as it is required to build and run the application. 

You can clone the https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/liberty-experimental[Open Liberty branch of the Cargo Tracker project] to your local machine by running:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker.git -b liberty-experimental
----

You can also follow the link above to take a peek at the code. 

== Maven setup

After cloning the project, you can quickly start Cargo Tracker through the command line with Maven. Navigate to the project base directory (where the pom.xml file is located) and run:

[source]
----
mvn -P openliberty liberty:dev
----
 
The application should start without any thrown exceptions, and the startup messages such as the message-driven bean activation warnings are cosmetic and can be safely ignored.

== Eclipse IDE setup

You'll need Eclipse JEE version 2022-03 or later to run the application. After cloning the project, import it into Eclipse by selecting the "File" menu and then "Import". Choose the "Existing Maven Projects" option inside the import menu. In the next step, select the repository base folder as the root directory and check the pom.xml under the "Projects" tab. Select "Finish" to complete the import process.

If you're working inside the Eclipse IDE, you'll need to install IBM's Liberty Tools plugin. Following the steps in the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/blob/main/docs/installation/installation.md[installation guide] should allow you to access some convenient new resources and operations specific to Liberty. There's a https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/08/01/liberty-tools-eclipse.html[blog post] that covers the plugin's capabilities in more detail, but for now we'll focus on the Liberty Dashboard. To run Cargo Tracker you'll need to right-click the `cargo-tracker` project and select the "Start with Parameters" option, which is second from the top. Then, you'll need to set the Open Liberty profile by typing in `-Popenliberty`.

After the Open Liberty profile is activated, the application should start inside the Eclipse console.

If you're using Mac OS, you may encounter a problem where Maven commands are not found inside the Eclipse IDE. You'll need to restart Eclipse through Finder by right-clicking your Eclipse application and choosing "Show Package Contents". Enter the newly displayed Contents folder, select MacOS, and then run Eclipse by clicking the executable.

== After starting the application

Once the application is running, you can access it through a browser of your choice at http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/ and start experimenting with it. You can track routed cargo through the Public Tracking interface, book and route cargo through the Administration interface (shown below), and update cargo object events using the Mobile Event Logger. You can stop the server at any time by using `CTRL-C`.

The https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/liberty-experimental/README.md[README.md] also contains step by step instructions for starting the application along with detailed explanations for each of the interface options on the home page. 

== Nice work! Where to next?

You've just set up Cargo Tracker and experienced Open Liberty with an enterprise-level application on your own machine! Check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/[Open Liberty guides] for more information on using Jakarta EE and MicroProfile with Open Liberty.
