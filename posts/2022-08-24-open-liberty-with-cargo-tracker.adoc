Open Liberty is known for its flexibility and working on top of Jakarta EE is no exception. As one of the top Java framework choices for enterprise-level applications, Jakarta EE can be found at the center of projects all over the globe. The Cargo Tracker open-source application was designed to replicate an enterprise application by utilizing core Jakarta EE features with professional development standards. Successfully running Cargo Tracker on an Open Liberty server proves that Open Liberty's versatility encompasses complex customer company applications that need to perform in the field. 

== The Cargo Tracker application

Cargo Tracker simulates an industry-developed freight tracking web application built with Jakarta EE 8. It utilizes domain-driven design principles and its open-source nature makes it an ideal candidate to demonstrate the enterprise-level performance of Open Liberty. The application uses multiple key Jakarta EE features, including Faces, CDI, enterprise beans, bean validation, REST, and JSON binding. Persistence is also implemented along with batching and JMS messaging. 

Functionally, the application is set up to book, track, update, and route cargo objects. Messaging events are logged to update cargo locations while persistence ensures that cargo status is not changed or removed when the application is shut down. Each portion of Cargo Tracker represents a step in a real-life shipment process: the customer tracks their cargo using the Public Tracking interface, the shipping company schedules and routes deliveries using the Administration interface, while handlers in ports log arriving and departing cargo using the Mobile Event Logger.

Cargo Tracker was originally developed to work with the Payara runtime and had not been previously used with Open Liberty, but the server switch preserved application functionality perfectly. There were no issues across operating systems, as the application ran consistently on Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 10, and Mac OS Monterey 12.4.

== Running Cargo Tracker with Open Liberty yourself

Feel free to give Cargo Tracker with Open Liberty a try on your own. Cargo Tracker supports Java SE 8, 11, and 17 â€” IBM Semeru Runtime is preferred when using Open Liberty. Before cloning the application, install any required JDKs and make sure that your JAVA_HOME is compatible. Finally, be sure that Maven is properly configured on your machine. 

https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/tree/liberty-experimental[You can clone the Open Liberty branch of the Cargo Tracker project here]. 

== Maven setup

After cloning the project, you can quickly start Cargo Tracker through the command line with Maven. Navigate to the project base directory (where the pom.xml file is located) and type `+mvn clean+`, then `+mvn -P openliberty liberty:dev+`. The application should start without any thrown exceptions, and the startup messages such as the message-driven bean activation warnings are cosmetic and can be safely ignored.

== Eclipse IDE setup

If you're working inside the Eclipse IDE, you'll need to install IBM's Liberty Tools plugin. Following the steps in https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/blob/main/docs/installation/installation.md[the installation guide] should allow you to access some convenient new resources and operations specific to Liberty. There's a https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/08/01/liberty-tools-eclipse.html[blog post] that covers the plugin's capabilities in more detail, but for now we'll focus on the Liberty Dashboard. To run Cargo Tracker here you'll need to right-click the `cargo-tracker` project and select the "Start with Parameters" option, which is second from the top. Then, you'll need to set the Open Liberty profile by typing in `-Popenliberty`.

After the Open Liberty profile is activated, the application should start inside the Eclipse console.

If you're using Mac OS, you may encounter a problem where Maven commands are not found inside the Eclipse IDE. You'll need to restart Eclipse through Finder by right-clicking your Eclipse application and choosing "Show Package Contents". Enter the newly displayed Contents folder, select MacOS, and then run Eclipse by clicking the executable. 

== After starting the application

Once the application is running, you can access it through a browser of your choice at http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/ and start experimenting with it. You can track routed cargo through the Public Tracking interface, book and route cargo through the Administration interface (shown below), and update cargo object events using the Mobile Event Logger.

The https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/blob/liberty-experimental/README.md[README.md] also contains step by step instructions for starting the application along with detailed explanations for each of the interface options on the home page. 

== Key takeway

Open Liberty's ability to run an enterprise-level Jakarta EE application originally configured for a different runtime is a testament to its adaptability. With this result, Open Liberty has proven that it is perfectly capable of handling not only Cargo Tracker, but the numerous other sophisticated industry applications that fall under the Jakarta EE umbrella.
