== Stand-alone user registries no longer forcefully federated (Password Utilities 1.1)

A new version of the Password Utilities feature, passwordUtilities-1.1, is available. This version of the feature does not start the Federated User Registry feature or the Jakarta Connectors feature. When you use this version of the feature, stand-alone user registries are not forcefully federated, which sometimes results in slightly different behavior than the previous version. The previous feature version, passwordUtilities-1.0, starts the Federated User Registry and Jakarta Connectors features by default. 

To enable Password Utilities 1.1, add the `passwordUtilities-1.1` feature to the list of features in your server.xml file:

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>passwordUtilities-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>

== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A22009+label%3A%22release+bug%22+[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.9].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22040[Invalid character warning for colon in WorkQueueManagerImplMBeanWrapper objectName]
+
A colon character ( `:` ) in the Apache CXF WorkQueueManagerImplMBeanWrapper class's objectName creates a warning and a `javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException` caused by the invalid `:` character when `javax.management.ObjectName.construct` is called. This issue occurs in Open Liberty 22.0.0.8, though it did not appear in 22.0.0.7.
+
A fix to this issue was made where by the removal of an invalid `:` character from URI base in the bus ID and resulted in no additional warning messages. More information can be found in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/22069[#22069]



* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22012[CXF property cxf.ignore.unsupported.policy is not processed correctly in Liberty 22.0.0.8]
+
In Liberty 22.0.0.8, when the JVM system property `cxf.ignore.unsupported.policy` is set to true, some unsupported policy assertions in the WSDL file are not ignored as expected.
+
This has since been resolved to now link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/22013[process the `cxf.ignore.unsupported.policy` correctly].


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21973[Expiration fields are not compared in an LTPA Token]
+
When two expiration times are present in an LTPA token, the times must be compared to confirm whether they are within an acceptable difference. 
+
The issue is fixed via link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21883[#21883] and 
Open Liberty will now reject LTPA tokens when the two expiration times in the token are not within an acceptable difference by throwing an invalidTokenException.


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21955[Liberty does not provide exported packages for java.* packages at runtime in the OSGi framework instance]
+
Starting with OSGi R7 Core specification, bundles are allowed to import (using `Import-Package` header) packages from `java.*` (e.g. `java.io`).  When installing a Liberty feature that includes a bundle that imports a `java.*` package, the bundle fails to resolve because Liberty does not configure the OSGi framework (Equinox in this case) to export the `java.*` packages available in the running JVM.
+
The issue is resolved via link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/16188[#16188] and Open Liberty will now configure the OSGi framework to export the available java.* packages for the running JVM.


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21937[MP Fault Tolerance 1.x can log an FFDC when a method times out at the same time as it completes]
+
When a method times out at the same time as it completes, an FFDC may be logged. Aside from the FFDC being logged, there are no other symptoms.
+
There has been a fix to timeout cancellation race condition which resolves:
+
A lock shared between `stop()` and `timeout()`, but if the timeout
has fired, the timeout future is not complete at the point where
`timeout()` releases the lock. This gives `stop()` a chance to run and
attempt to cancel the future. Doing this results in an
`InterruptedException` which causes and FFDC to be emitted by the policy
executor.
+
By checking the value of timeout, it avoids trying to cancel the
timeout task if the timeout has already fired and interrupted our
thread. There has also been a package added to the FT trace group.
+ 
Both the fix to the timeout cancellation race condition and adding the package to trace group has resolved the issue of link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21936[MP Fault Tolerance 1.x]. 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21880[OpenAPI 2.0+ throws error at startup]
+
After enabling mpOpenApi-2.0 or mpOpenApi-3.0. at startup, link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21880[this error] might occur because the MP OpenAPI implementation tries to get a MicroProfile Config object before the MicroProfile Config feature has initialized.
+
This issue was fixed by only calling `Config.getConfig()` when needed, rather than when
the component starts to avoid occasional cases where the config component hasn't initialized yet. The fixes are  in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21881[#21881]


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21858[Multiple protocols not always getting honored with the IBMJDK]
+
When the IBM JDK is being used not all protocols in a list of protocols will get honored.
+
After the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21859[fix], each protocol in the list should be able to be used in a connection as long as the protocol is not disabled in the Security configuration.
