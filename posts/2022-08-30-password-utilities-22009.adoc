== Stand-alone user registries no longer forcefully federated (Password Utilities 1.1)

The new `passwordUtilities-1.1` feature no longer starts the `federatedRegistry-1.0` feature or the Jakarta Connectors feature.
Stand-alone user registries are no longer forcefully federated, which sometimes results in slightly different behavior.

To enable Password Utilities 1.1, add the `passwordUtilities-1.1` feature to the list of features in your server.xml file:

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>passwordUtilities-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>

== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A22009+label%3A%22release+bug%22+[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.9].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22040[Invalid character warning for colon in WorkQueueManagerImplMBeanWrapper objectName]
+
A colon character in the Apache CXF WorkQueueManagerImplMBeanWrapper class's objectName creates a warning and a `javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException` caused by the invalid `:` character when `javax.management.ObjectName.construct` is called. This issue occurs in Open Liberty 22.0.0.8 when it did not appear in 22.0.0.7.
+
A fix to this issue was made where by the removal of an invalid `:` character from URI base in the bus ID resulted in no additional warning messages. More information can be found in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/22069[#22069]



* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22012[CXF property cxf.ignore.unsupported.policy is not processed correctly in Liberty 22.0.0.8]
+
In Liberty 22.0.0.8, when the JVM system property `cxf.ignore.unsupported.policy` is set to true, some unsupported policy assertions in the WSDL file are not ignored as expected.
+
This has since been resolved to now process link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/22013[`cxf.ignore.unsupported.policy` correctly].


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21973[Expiration fields are not compared in an LTPA Token]
+
When there are two expiration times present in an LTPA token, the times should be compared to be within an acceptable difference. 
+
There have been changes made to handling LTPAToken2 resulting in a fix to the issue. More information about these changes can be found in this issue link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21883[#21883] 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21955[Liberty does not provide exported packages for java.* packages at runtime in the OSGi framework insteance]
+
Starting with OSGi R7 Core specification, bundles are allowed to import (using `Import-Package` header) packages from `java.*` (e.g. `java.io`).  When installing a liberty feature that includes a bundle that imports a `java.*` package the bundle fails to resolve because Liberty does not configure the OSGi framework (Equinox in this case) to export the `java.*` packages available in the running JVM.
+
Multiple changes had been requested at link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/16188[#16188] in order to fix the issue and subsequently have now been resolved. 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21937[MP Fault Tolerance 1.x can log an FFDC when a method times out at the same time as it completes]
+
When a method times out at the same time as it completes, an FFDC may be logged. Aside from the FFDC being logged, there are no other symptoms.
+
There has been a fix to timeout cancellation race condition which resolves:
+
A lock shared between `stop()` and `timeout()`, but if the timeout
has fired, the timeout future is not complete at the point where
`timeout()` releases the lock. This gives `stop()` a chance to run and
attempt to cancel the future. Doing this results in an
`InterruptedException` which causes and FFDC to be emitted by the policy
executor.
+
By checking the value of timeout, it avoids trying to cancel the
timeout task if the timeout has already fired and interrupted our
thread. There has also been a package added to the FT trace group.
+ 
Both the fix to the timeout cancellation race condition and adding the package to trace group has resolved the issue of link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21936[MP Fault Tolerance 1.x]. 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21880[OpenAPI 2.0+ throws error at startup]
+
After enabling mpOpenApi-2.0 or mpOpenApi-3.0. at startup, an error which can be found 
link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21880[here] may occur because the MP OpenAPI implementation tries to get a MicroProfile Config object before the MicroProfile Config feature has initialized.
+
This issue was fixed by only calling `Config.getConfig()` when needed, rather than when
the component starts to avoid occasional cases where the config component hasn't initialized yet. The fixes around found in link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21881[#21881]


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21858[Multiple protocols not always getting honored with the IBMJDK]
+
When the IBM JDK is being used not all protocols in a list of protocols will get honored.
+
After the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/21859[fix], each protocol in the list should be able to be used in a connection as long as the protocol is not disabled in the Security configuration.
