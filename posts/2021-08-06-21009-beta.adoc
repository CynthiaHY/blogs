Open Liberty 21.0.0.9-beta offers exciting new enhancements for Liberty embedders such as endpoint activation monitoring to determine when endpoints are available to use. 

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.
[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features:

* <<method, New method to determine active endpoints>>
* link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2021/07/12/logging-format-21008-beta.html#mp4_1[MicroProfile 4.1]


[#method]
=== New method to determine active endpoints

The `ServerEndpointControlMBean` can currently be used to pause and resume endpoints, including `HTTP` and messaging ports. It can also determine if an endpoint is currently paused. However, there is no way to determine programmatically if an endpoint exists and is active. This update provides a new method on the `mbean`, `isActive`, that will determine if an endpoint exists, has started, and is not paused.
A new method was added to the `ServerEndpointControlMBean`:

`public boolean isActive(String targets);`

The `targets` parameter is a comma separated list of endpoint names. 

This mirrors the existing `isPaused` method. It will return true only if all of the endpoints listed exist, are started, and are not paused.

[source, java]
----
// Check if the defaultHttpEndpoint is active
boolean isEndpointActive = mbean.isActive("defaultHttpEndpoint");
----

When an invalid endpoint is passed to `isActive`, the method returns `False`, even if the other endpoints are all valid.

[source, java]
----
assertFalse("False should be returned when an invalid endpoint is passed to isActive", mbean.isActive("inValidTargetName!"));

// create a list of valid endpoints
String targets = createHttpEndpoints(4);
// add an invalid endpoint
targets += ",invalidEndpoint";

// Check if the defaultHttpEndpoint is active
// isEndpointActive should be False
boolean isEndpointActive = mbean.isActive(targets);
----

When a valid endpoint is passed to `isActive`, the method returns `False` if any of the endpoints are paused.

[source, java]
----
// pause active endpoint
try {
    mbean.pause("defaultHttpEndpoint");
} catch (MBeanException e) {
    fail("Got unexpected exception from attempting to pause a endpoint with a valid target 'defaultHttpEndpoint':" + e.getCause());
}

// Check if the defaultHttpEndpoint is active
// isEndpointActive should be False as endpoint is paused
boolean isEndpointActive = mbean.isActive(targets);

// Resume all targets
mbean.resume();
----

For more information about `ServerEndpointControlMBean` methods, refer to the link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/nd?topic=SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.liberty.doc/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.api.kernel.service_1.0-javadoc/com/ibm/websphere/kernel/server/ServerEndpointControlMBean.html[API documentation].


=== Try it now 

To try out these features, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 15, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], here are the coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
  <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
  <version>21.0.0.9-beta</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]

dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[21.0.0.9-beta,)'

[#jakarta]
== Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package

Open Liberty is the first vendor product to be Jakarta EE Web Profile 9.0 compatible since the 21.0.0.2-beta release. Open Liberty is also the first vendor product to be added to the link:https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/#tab-9[Jakarta EE Platform 9.0 compatability list], with the release of 21.0.0.3-beta. 
Open Liberty 21.0.0.6-beta further expanded on this compatability by including new Jakarta EE9 supporting features, and 21.0.0.9-beta offers the same compatability with Jakarta EE9 with performance enhancements. 

Enable the Jakarta EE 9 beta features in your app's `server.xml`. You can enable the individual features you want or you can just add the Jakarta EE 9 convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

Or you can add the Web Profile convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

=== Try it now

To try out these Jakarta EE 9 features on Open Liberty in a lightweight package, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 15, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.
