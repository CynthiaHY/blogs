[#Intro]

#About A/B testing

A/B testing is a method of running multiple versions of a single application simultaneously to test and compare the performance and user experiance of the application. A/B testing can be executed as a random version testing or using fixed number of hits on either version of application. A/B testing model are executed by either the consent of user or without leaving a choice to the user based on the requirement, for example, sometimes users are given an option to select old version or newer version of an application to do their business. This testing method helps product owner to get clear evidence of user choices. A/B testing need more resources and time to get the desired results compared to other testing models.

#About kubernetes 

This focus of this blog is more about technical steps to do the A/B testing using Kubernetes technology. Kubernetes is a open source platform for managing containerized applications workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes works with Docker runtime engine as well as other wide variety of container engines. Kubernetes cluster can be installed on your own datacenter ( link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/[Install kubernetes] ) or directly use a host kubernetes service (eg: link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/ [Azure kubernetes service] )

#A/B testing kubernetes architecture diagram

A simple A/B testing kubernetes setup architecture is given below. A sample application is deployed on kubernetes pods and external access is controlled by services. The instances of application pods deployed (eg: 6 green application instance and 2 red application instance as shown in this diagram) and the amount of user traffic routed to deployed application (eg: 80% traffic to green application instance and 20% to red application instances as shown in this diagram) are decided based on the overall A/B testing architectural plan.

#some A/B testing terminologies and worthiness check
*Variant:* Variant is the term for any new versions of a application which you include in your A/B test. 
*Champion:* Champion is the best performing instance in all of the A/B testing participating instances. 
*Challenger:* Challengers are the new version/intances added to the A/B testing to challenge the existing champion. If a challenger outperforms 
              all other variants, it becomes the new champion.
