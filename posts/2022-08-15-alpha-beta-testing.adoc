[#Intro]

#About A/B testing

A/B testing is a method of running multiple versions of a single application simultaneously to test and compare the performance and user experiance of the application. A/B testing can be executed as a random sampling testing or using fixed number of hits on either version of application. A/B testing model are executed by either the consent of user or without leaving a choice to the user based on the requirement, for example, sometimes users are given an option to select old version or newer version of an application to work on. This testing method helps product owner to get clear evidence of user choices. A/B testing need more resources and time to get the desired results compared to other testing models.
