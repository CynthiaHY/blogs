[#Intro]

=== About A/B testing

A/B testing is a method of running multiple versions of a single application simultaneously to test and compare the performance and user experiance of the application. A/B testing can be executed as a random version testing or using fixed number of hits on either version of application. A/B testing model are executed by either the consent of user or without leaving a choice to the user based on the requirement, for example, sometimes users are given an option to select old version or newer version of an application to do their business. This testing method helps product owner to get clear evidence of user choices. A/B testing need more resources and time to get the desired results compared to other testing models.

=== About kubernetes 

This focus of this blog is more about technical steps to do the A/B testing using Kubernetes technology. Kubernetes is a open source platform for managing containerized applications workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes works with Docker runtime engine as well as other wide variety of container engines. Kubernetes cluster can be installed on your own datacenter ( link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/[Install kubernetes] ) or directly use a host kubernetes service (eg: link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/ [Azure kubernetes service] )

=== A/B testing kubernetes architecture diagram

A simple A/B testing kubernetes setup architecture is given below. A sample application is deployed on kubernetes pods and external access is controlled by services. The instances of application pods deployed (eg: 6 green application instance and 2 red application instance as shown in this diagram) and the amount of user traffic routed to deployed application (eg: 80% traffic to green application instance and 20% to red application instances as shown in this diagram) are decided based on the overall A/B testing architectural plan.

=== A/B testing terminologies and worthiness check

Various well known A/B testing terminolories are + 

*Variant:* Variant is the term for any new versions of a application which you include in your A/B test. +
*Champion:* Champion is the best performing instance in all of the A/B testing participating instances. +
*Challenger:* Challengers are the new version/intances added to the A/B testing to challenge the existing champion. If a challenger outperforms all other variants, it becomes the new champion. 

In terms of worthiness check, i am listing out various obstacles to consider +

*Requirement of enough statistical data* A/B testing need a very signification data backing to decide a champion, even a small stats can be used to decide on a champion, but that won't relect the actual preference of the users. For example, we can select a champion based on 6 out of 10 clicks of a particular feature, but its clear that these much data is not enough to decide what users like the most. +
*Requirement of huge usage traffic* If a particular feature under test doesn't get enough traffic over a period of time, then the test may take months or years to complete and that won't help in faster feature rollout plans +
*One-Size-Fits-All approach* Once we decide to select a particular variant after A/B testing, we are neglecting a set of users like who would have been choosing other variants. These neglected users may fall users high value category and the company is risking their annoyance in these kind of scenarious. 

=== Prerequistes for understaing this blog

In this blog post, I will assume that you have a basic understanding of Kubernetes. 

== A/B testing component setup on Kubernetes

There are various ways to impletement A/B testing infrastracture in Kubernetes platform, I will be explaining you one of those methods and below given kubernetes deployment and service file contents are going to help you for that.  

In simple terms, we are going to create 2 setup of kubernetes deployment instance, one will be returning 'Green' result and the other one will be returning 'red' result. These deployment instances will be bind together and exposed with a kubernetes service instance. More details are given below.

Kubernetes deployment config for 'RED' instance

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: deployment-red
    spec:
      replicas: 10
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: example_code #unique identifier labels, key component in A/B testing
            color: red #unique identifier labels, key component in A/B testing
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: echocolor
              image: reselbob/echocolor:v0.1  #Docker Image details
              ports:
                - containerPort: 3000
              env:
                - name: COLOR_ECHO_COLOR
                    value: RED
                - name: COLOR_ECHO_VERSION
                    value: V1

Kubernetes deployment config for 'GREEN' instance

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: deployment-red
    spec:
      replicas: 10
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: example_code #unique identifier labels, key component in A/B testing
            color: green #unique identifier labels, key component in A/B testing
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: echocolor
              image: reselbob/echocolor:v0.1  #Docker Image details
              ports:
                - containerPort: 3000
              env:
                - name: COLOR_ECHO_COLOR
                    value: GREEN
                - name: COLOR_ECHO_VERSION
                    value: V1
