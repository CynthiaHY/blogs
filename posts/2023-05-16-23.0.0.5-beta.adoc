=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] beta releases include the mentioned beta features along with link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features]. The beta works with Java SE 20, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.5-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta Data beta 2, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta-data-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-b2</version>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.5-beta,)'
}
----

Or if you're using link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[container images]:

[source]
----
FROM icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:beta
----

Or take a look at our link:{url-prefix}/downloads/#runtime_betas[Downloads page].
