[#Intro]

Secrets are confidential information which is very sensitive in nature and hence it's access are restricted. In general, multiple layers of security are used in storing and retriving secrets like passwords and tokens. Kubernetes/OpenShift has provisions internally to secure the secrets, but in many cases application security team does not prefer to store the secrets permanently on kubernetes cluster to which non-application team will have access. Vendor tools like HashiCorp Vault come to the rescue in such requirements. 

== Hashicorp Vault and Kubernetes

HashiCorp vault is a secret management tool which help organisations to store and transmit secrets securely. Identity based access to HashiCorp vault are controlled by well defined HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) based 'Policies'. Role-based access control (RBAC) based policies are used for comtrolling human access and Dynamically generated secret based access control (using tools like 'Consul') are used to authenticate machine access. Vault provides “encryption as a service,” encrypting data in transit (with TLS) and at rest (using AES 256-bit CBC encryption) and hence vault make sure that data is encrypted always. 

This focus of this blog is about hosting Hashicorp vault server in Kubernetes and also how to security access vault secrets kubernetes pods.  Kubernetes is a open source platform for managing containerized applications workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes works with Docker runtime engine as well as other wide variety of container engines. Kubernetes cluster can be installed on your own datacenter ( link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/[Install kubernetes] ) or directly use a host kubernetes service (eg: link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/ [Azure kubernetes service] )
