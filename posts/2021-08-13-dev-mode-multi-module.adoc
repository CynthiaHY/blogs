= Dev mode support for multi-module Maven projects

When developing a cloud-native Java application that is built using Maven, a common way to organize your project is to separate it into multiple sub-projects, or modules.  Each module is a Maven project that can have dependencies on other modules.  An aggregator project lists all of the modules that should be built together, which defines the overall multi-module project.  The Maven reactor is used with this project to collect, sort, and build the modules in the correct order.

In this blog post, we introduce Open Liberty dev mode support for working with multi-module Maven projects.  This provides hot deployment of changes in all modules of a Maven reactor build, on-demand and hot testing for multiple modules, and the ability to attach a debugger to debug code in any module.  

Dev mode support for multi-module Maven projects is available starting in version `3.4` of the Liberty Maven plug-in, which is available now.

== Multi-module projects

With multi-module Maven projects, there is a top-level aggregator `pom.xml` file that manages a group of submodules. This is convenient as you can use one single command to build the entire project, and the Maven reactor will determine the correct build order for you.  

The following example is the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guide-maven-multimodules[Open Liberty multi module sample application]. This project contains three modules, a Java library in the `jar` folder, a web module in the `war` folder, and template files and the Liberty server configuration in the `ear` folder.

|_ ear
    |_pom.xml
    |_src
        |_main/liberty/config
        |_test/java
----

Each submodule is defined in the top-level aggregator `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
    <modules>
        <module>jar</module>
        <module>war</module>
        <module>ear</module>
    </modules>
----

The modules within the project can also have dependencies on each other. In this example, the `war` module depends on the `jar` module, and the `ear` module depends on both the `war` and `jar` modules. By leveraging dev mode for multiple modules, not only will the code changes you make be automatically picked up and hot deployed, but any dependent modules will also be recompiled and hot deployed.

== Running dev mode on a multi-module project

=== Starting dev mode

To start dev mode, from the directory containing the top-level multi module pom.xml, run:

----
mvn io.openliberty.tools:liberty-maven-plugin:3.4:dev 
----

Once dev mode starts successfully, changes in all modules are detected and hot deployed. By default, any dependent modules will also be recompiled and deployed. For example, if a change is made in the war module of this project, the ear module will also be recompiled, as it depends on the war module.

=== Starting dev mode with container support

There is container support for multiple module projects and dev mode. Use the `devc` command to start dev mode with container support.

----
mvn io.openliberty.tools:liberty-maven-plugin:3.4:devc  
----

If your Dockerfile is not in the same directory as where you started the dev mode command from, you can point to it with the `-Ddockerfile=<path-to-dockerfile>` paremeter. For more information on Dockerfiles for your Open Liberty application, see the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#building-an-application-image[Open Liberty Docker image documentation]. 

=== Running tests
You can run tests on all modules by pressing Enter. 

**gif of enter to run tests**

You can also enable hot tests so that tests will run on every code change. To enable hot tests, add the `-DhotTests` parameter: `mvn io.openliberty.tools:liberty-maven-plugin:3.4:dev -DhotTests`. With hot tests enabled, tests will run on the module that was changed and any dependent modules.

=== Stopping dev mode

You can exit dev mode by pressing Control-C, or type `q` and press Enter in the terminal.
