// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title.
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-02-generate-microprofile-rest-client-code.adoc

// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is

== What's New

=== Type-ahead completion for Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, and Liberty configuration files

In this early release, we add all new type-ahead completion assistance for your Liberty configuration files and Jakarta EE and MicroProfile APIs.

Liberty configuration assistance provides code completion in Liberty `server.xml`, `server.env`, and `bootstrap.properties` files. For example, the completion in the following example offers possible Liberty features you can configure in your `server.xml` file's `featureManager` block.

Editing assistance provides code completion in configuration and application files for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile APIs. For example, the `rest_get` code completion in the following example inserts a code snippet for a RESTful Web Services `GET` method.

=== Navigate using the Go to Action menu

If you prefer to work entirely through keyboard shortcuts, all Liberty actions can now be run through the IntelliJ *Go to Action* menu. You can access the menu either by pressing `Shift` twice, then selecting the Actions tab, or by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A`  or  `Cmd` + `Shift` + `A`.

=== Attach a debugger at startup

When you select the Liberty *Start...* action from the Liberty tool window or IntelliJ *Go To Action* menu, you can configure a new run configuration with Maven or Gradle parameters to pass to the `mvn liberty:dev` or `gradle libertyDev` commands. This configuration integrates into the IntelliJ IDEA run/debug configuration view.

When you select the newly created Liberty run configuration and then select the IntelliJ *Debug* icon, your Liberty server will start and attach a JVM debugger all in one step. The *Debug* action will determine an available port on your system and pass that port to dev mode. As soon as dev mode starts, you can start debugging your application through the built-in IntelliJ IDEA debug view.
