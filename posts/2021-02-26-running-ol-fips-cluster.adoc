= Deploying an Open Liberty application to OpenShift with FIPS enabled
Monica Tamboli <https://github.com/mtamboli>

In this post, I'll show you how to run an Open Liberty application with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) enabled and deploy it to an OpenShift cluster.
First, let's cover some key concepts about FIPS and running Open Liberty with FIPS enabled.

== What is FIPS and why is it important?

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are standards and guidelines that are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for federal government computer systems.
Federal agencies and other industries rely on cryptography to protect digital information (data at rest) and communications (data in motion).
FIPS specifies the security requirements that a cryptographic module must satisfy to protect sensitive information.
The FIPS certification process requires testing by a NIST-accredited lab and assures users that a specific technology can be used to secure sensitive information.

Because United States government agencies and other healthcare and financial firms use only products that support FIPS, it can be important to enable FIPS when you deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

== Considerations for enabling FIPS

* **Kubernetes cluster considerations**
+
First, you need to decide whether to install your Kubernetes cluster in FIPS mode.
In this blog, we'll use OpenShift 4.6.
Starting in version 4.3, you can https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing-fips.html[install an OpenShift cluster that uses FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries].
A FIPS-enabled Open Liberty image can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster that isn't FIPS-enabled.

* **Open Liberty considerations**
+
Open Liberty can run with any compliant Java runtime environment (JRE) or Java software development kit (SDK).
When you enable FIPS, it is important to pick correct Java withs FIPS validated providers.
In this post, we'll use Open Liberty with the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.80.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/enablefips.html[IBM JDK 8 with IBMJSSE2 FIPS provider].
Open Liberty supports FIPS 140-2, SP800-131, and Suite B security standards.
It is important to consider all the dependencies of your application on other software.
It's possible that your application could stop working after enabling FIPS if the other software that your application interacts with isn't FIPS-compliant.

== Enabling FIPS and deploying the application container image

Let's explore the steps to enable FIPS for an Open Liberty application that's running on a FIPS-enabled OpenShift cluster:

. <<create-image-fips,Creating an Open Liberty application container image that has FIPS enabled>>
. <<deploy-image-cluster,Deploying the Open Liberty image to your OpenShift cluster>>

[#create-image-fips]
=== Creating an Open Liberty application container image that has FIPS enabled

First, https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker#container-images[create an Open Liberty application container image].
To enable FIPS for Open Liberty, we're using the Open Liberty image that uses the IBM JDK 8.
You also need to ensure that Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enabled for your Open Liberty server by adding the xref:/docs/latest/reference/feature/transportSecurity-1.0.html[Transport Security feature] (`transportSecurity-1.0`) to your `server.xml` file.

Set the correct system property to https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.80.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/enablefips.html[enable FIPS mode in the IBMJSSE2 provider].
For FIPS140-2, set the `-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.usefipsprovider=true` property.
SP800-131a can also be enabled by using the `-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.sp800-131=transition` property or the `-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.sp800-131=strict` property.
To set this system property, create or update the `jvm.options` file:
----
$ cat jvm.options
-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.usefipsprovider=true
----

Next, add the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) FIPS provider in the `java.security` file, which is located in the `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security` directory.
You can extract the `java.security` file from the Open Liberty running pod by running the following command:
----
$ docker cp <container>:/opt/ibm/java/jre/lib/security/java.security .
----

By default, the `java.security` file doesn't include a FIPS provider.
This example uses the `com.ibm.crypto.fips.provider.IBMJCEFIPS` FIPS provider, although there is a newer version of the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.80.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/enablefips.html[com.ibm.crypto.plus.provider.IBMJCEPlusFIPS` FIPS provider].

After you extract the `java.security` file, add the FIPS provider and adjust the provider number in the file:
----
$ vi java.security
# List of providers and their preference orders (see above):
#Added the security.provider.1=com.ibm.crypto.fips.provider.IBMJCEFIPS on top
security.provider.1=com.ibm.crypto.fips.provider.IBMJCEFIPS
security.provider.2=com.ibm.jsse2.IBMJSSEProvider2
security.provider.3=com.ibm.crypto.provider.IBMJCE
.....
----

Next, update the Dockerfile with updated `server.xml`, `jvm.options`, and `java.security` files, as shown in the following example Dockerfile:
----
FROM openliberty/open-liberty:21.0.0.1-full-java8-ibmjava-ubi

COPY --chown=1001:0  server.xml /config/
COPY --chown=1001:0  jvm.options /config/
COPY --chown=1001:0 <app> /config/apps
COPY --chown=1001:0 java.security /opt/ibm/java/jre/lib/security
RUN configure.sh
----

Now you can run the following command to build the updated Open Liberty image:
----
$ docker build -t <image_name> -f Dockerfile .
----

If you want, you can verify the application container image that you created to make sure that the correct FIPS provider is being used.
To verify the image, enable JSSE trace by using the `-Djavax.net.debug=all` property:
----
$ docker run -e JVM_ARGS=-Djavax.net.debug=all -p 9443:443 <image_name>

Finally, log in to your image registry and push the image.
In this example, we're using the OpenShift internal registry:
----
$ docker login <registry>
$ docker tag <image_name> default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.example.ibm.com/ol-app/<image_name>
$ docker push default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.example.ibm.com/ol-app/<image_name>
----

[#deploy-image-cluster]
=== Deploying the Open Liberty image to your OpenShift Cluster

Start off by deploying an OpenShift cluster.
Then, install the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator#operator-installation[Open Liberty Operator] if it's not already installed.
Next, log in to your OpenShift cluster with the `oc login` command, and create a project for your Open Liberty application:
----
$ oc new-project ol-app
----

Create an https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/blob/master/doc/user-guide.adoc[OpenLibertyApplication custom resource (CR)] to deploy your application.
It's important that route for the application is enabled so that TLS can use FIPS.
The following example file shows how you might configure the Open Liberty Operator for deployment to an OpenShift cluster.
Make sure to replace `<image_name>` with the name of your image:
----
$ cat app-deploy.yaml
apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: inventory-ibmjdk
spec:
  replicas: 1
  applicationImage: default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.example.ibm.com/ol-app/<image_name>
  expose: true
  route:
    termination: reencrypt
  service:
    annotations:
      service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: inventory-ibmjdk-svc-tls
    certificateSecretRef: inventory-ibmjdk-svc-tls
    port: 9443
----

Now you're ready to deploy the application to OpenShift by running the following command:
----
$ oc apply -f app-deploy.yaml
----

You can also use the `oc get pods` and `oc get routes` commands to check the pod and route of your application:
----
$ oc get pods
inventory-ibmjdk-687487479-4rxk7   1/1     Running   0          36h
$ oc get routes|grep jdk
inventory-ibmjdk   inventory-ibmjdk-ol-app.apps.example.ibm.com          inventory-ibmjdk   9443-tcp   reencrypt     None
----

You can open a browser and access the route that was returned by the `oc get routes` command, for example, https://inventory-ibmjdk-ol-app.apps.example.ibm.com.

== Summary

Security is obviously a high priority for any organization with growing number of security threats.
Running your enterprise applications in a FIPS-enabled runtime and Kubernetes cluster ensures that validated cryptographic modules are used.
It's important to consider all the dependencies of an application before you enable FIPS to make sure that the application will continue to work when it's FIPS-compliant.
If you're already running Open Liberty applications with FIPS enabled on-premises, you can move to Kubernetes.
Just make sure that you pick the Open Liberty image with FIPS-supported Java and update the container image with FIPS-enabled files.
