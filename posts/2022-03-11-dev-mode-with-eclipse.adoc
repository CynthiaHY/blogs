= Rapid cloud-native development in the Eclipse IDE with Liberty dev mode

The Eclipse IDE (integrated development environment) continues to be one of the most popular IDEs among Java developers. In this post we showcase how Liberty dev mode and the Liberty Developer Tools Eclipse plugin ensure a seamless development experience for cloud-native Java developers.

https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[Liberty dev mode] enables developers to quickly and iteratively develop cloud-native Java applications with the latest Jakarta EE and MicroProfile technologies. Dev mode will watch your project for file changes and provide hot reload and deployment, on demand testing, and debugger support. You can work with dev mode from anywhere, whether it's from a terminal with a text editor or your favorite IDE. https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ibm-liberty-developer-tools[Liberty Developer Tools] is an Eclipse plugin that provides helpful server configuration editor views. In the following sections we detail the current best practice for using dev mode, and optionally Liberty Developer Tools, to develop your application within the Eclipse IDE.

Check out a demo of working with Liberty dev mode in the Eclipse IDE:

== Working with dev mode in the Eclipse IDE with Liberty Developer Tools installed

If you have Liberty Developer Tools installed in your Eclipse workspace, the server configuration editor views can be helpful as you modify your `server.xml` and other configuration files.

Dev mode handles a lot of the heavy lifting for developers when using the Liberty runtime. With dev mode, you no longer need to manage your Liberty instances through the "Servers" view of Liberty Developer Tools.
Disable Liberty Developer Tools' integration for Maven and Gradle projects:

* For Maven projects: **Window -> Preferences -> Maven -> Liberty Integration** drop-down to "No".

* For Gradle projects: **Window -> Preferences -> Gradle -> Liberty Integration** drop-down to "No".

== Setting up the project

For Maven projects, specify the Liberty Maven Plugin in your project's `pom.xml` file:
[source,xml]
----
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.5.1</version>
    </plugin>
----

For Gradle projects, specify the Liberty Gradle Plugin in your project's `build.gradle` file:
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.3'
    }
}

== Interacting with dev mode
=== Starting dev mode

Start dev mode through the Eclipse IDE terminal (Navigate to your project in the package explorer -> Right-click -> "Show in Terminal") or through your operating system's terminal with the following commands:

* Maven: `mvn liberty:dev`
* Gradle: `gradle libertyDev`

=== Running tests

You can run tests on demand by pressing Enter in the terminal running dev mode.

=== Attaching a debugger

You can attach a debugger to the running server to step through your code at any time. In Eclipse you can create a debug configuration by selecting "Run" -> "Debug Configurations..." -> "Remote Java application". The default port for debugging is `7777`.

=== Stopping dev mode

You can quit dev mode at any time by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal, or type 'q' and press Enter.
