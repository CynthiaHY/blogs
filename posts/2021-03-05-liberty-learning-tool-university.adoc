University students are the next generation of software engineers. As such, they need opportunities to experience real-life scenarios of building applications for clients, with tools that are used in today's applications. These experiences provide students with a deeper understanding of the end-to-end process of application development and help them to develop critical and practical skills for their future careers.

IBM developers recently worked with the professors at https://ww1.oswego.edu/[SUNY Oswego] to create a 15-week project in which students to created a web-application by using Open Liberty, MicroProfile, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This project gave students hands-on experience delivering software for a client with open source tools and technologies. During this assignment, students also learned methodologies like IBM Design Thinking and agile scrum.

The students used Open Liberty to build a successful microservice-based application with on a deadline. The https://www.openliberty.io/guides/[interactive guides on the Open Liberty site] were important teaching tools for them to solve specific technical challenges in building an app from scratch. The project also gave students an appreciation for open source tools and how they can help contribute to these tools through open collaboration with the community.

The students enjoyed the project and they learned many new skills. They also made important connections to working professionals in the industry. You can check out https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaboration-excitement-between-suny-oswego-ibm-danielle-larosa[the article they wrote] for their perspective of the project.

From an IBM perspective, the project helped us gain interesting and helpful feedback from the students on our Open Liberty guides and documentation.
