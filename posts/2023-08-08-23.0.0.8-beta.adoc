[#SUB_TAG_0]
== SpringBoot 3.0 Support

1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to? 
    
Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature):
Spring Boot 3 
Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0):
springboot-3.0
    </GHA-BLOG-RELATED-FEATURES>

    <GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.  
    Liberty developers who want to take advantage of utilizing Spring Boot 3.x function within their Liberty applications.  Currently we support up through Spring Boot 3.1.
    </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
   
    <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?  
    
Open Liberty currently supports running Spring Boot 1.5 and Spring Boot 2.0 applications.  Additionally, a Spring Boot 3.x applications can be exported as a .war file and executed on Liberty (https://openliberty.io/blog/2023/06/15/running-spring-boot-3.html).  With the creation of this new Spring Boot 3.0 feature, users will now have support for both .wars and .jars by enabling the springboot-3.0 feature.

This feature provides more complete support for running a Sprint Boot 3.0 application on Open Liberty as well as having the capability to thin the application when creating applications in containers.

To utilize the Spring Boot 3.x functionality, the user must be running with Java 17 or higher.  Additionally, if your application utilizes servlet, it will need to use servlet 6.0.  These features would be configured in the server.xml file as follows:

```
<features>
   <feature>springboot-3.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>
</features>
```
Additionally, in server.xml configuring your Spring Boot application is similar to previous Liberty Spring Boot versions:

```
 <springBootApplication id="spring-boot-app" location="spring-boot-app-0.1.0.jar" name="spring-boot-app" />
```

A few migration notes for using Spring Boot 3:

- Need JakartaEE10 versions of components.  See:

https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/webProfile-10.0.html

- Security configuration requires in-application modifications.  See:

https://spring.io/blog/2022/02/21/spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter

https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72381114/spring-security-upgrading-the-deprecated-websecurityconfigureradapter-in-spring

- A new server template is available:
springBoot3

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.8-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:
