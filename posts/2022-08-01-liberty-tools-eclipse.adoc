= Introducing Liberty Tools for the Eclipse IDE
Adam Wisniewski <https://github.com/awisniew90>

Liberty Tools for Eclipse provides a new experience for developing applications with Open Liberty. This early release supports editing Liberty `server.xml` configuration, developing MicroProfile applications, a Liberty Dashboard for organizing your projects, and Liberty dev mode functions, all from within your IDE. 

Check out this quick video demo:

== Liberty Dashboard

The Liberty Dashboard keeps all of your Maven and Gradle projects organized and is automatically populated with projects that are configured to run with Open Liberty. With a few clicks, you can start and stop your app, run tests, and view test reports. 

== Dev mode

link:/docs/latest/development-mode.html[Liberty dev mode] automatically picks up your code changes and deploys them to your running app, without having to restart the server. With Liberty Tools, your app starts in dev mode automatically, giving you all of the benefits of faster development. 

== MicroProfile and Liberty config support

Configuring your Liberty server is now simpler than ever with server configuration auto-complete, validation, and hover-over descriptions in your IDE.

Also, you can quickly develop MicroProfile applications with automatic code blocks, auto-complete, and real-time MicroProfile syntax validation. 


== Try it out

=== Installing Liberty Tools for Eclipse

For installation instructions, see link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/blob/main/docs/installation/installation.md[Liberty Tools for Eclipse].

=== Using the Dashboard

After you install the plug-in, look for the Open Liberty UFO logo in the menu. Click the icon to open the Liberty Dashboard tab:

The Dashboard automatically populates with any Maven and Gradle projects in your workspace that are configured to run with Open Liberty, with the server.xml file in the default location. If you do not have any apps in your current workspace, try importing one, like the link:https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started[Open Liberty Starter app]. Once you import an app, refresh the Dashboard tab by clicking the refresh icon.

You should see your app listed in the dashboard. Right-click on the app and you will see a dropdown with a list of actions.
