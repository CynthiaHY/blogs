We are excited to announce the release of our newest tutorial, A Technical Deep Dive on Liberty!

Our team has been hard at work to produce a single end-to-end tutorial that covers important cloud-native concepts, developing and deploying applications and microservices using open cloud-native Java APIs in Jakarta EE and MicroProfile while following best practices for working with Liberty. This tutorial is aimed to help developers, from Liberty novices to those more experienced, develop, build, test, and deploy your applications on Liberty running in Kubernetes and clouds.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build RESTful microservice on Liberty with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile, documenting your REST API, externalizing configuration, persisting data to a database, securing your application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), adding health checks, providing metrics, testing your applications and more. You will also look at building container image for your Java microservice and deploying it to Kubernetes using the Open Liberty Operator.

You can access the tutorial directly link:{url-prefix}/guides/liberty-deep-dive.html[through this link].

Conveniently, this lab is also available for you to try in our cloud-hosted environment, without having to worry about local setup and prerequisites. Simply head over to the link:{url-prefix}/guides/liberty-deep-dive.html[tutorial page] and click the green *'Run in cloud'* button. Alternatively, you can access the cloud-hosted tutorial via link:https://ibm.biz/LibertyDeepDive[https://ibm.biz/LibertyDeepDive] directly.
