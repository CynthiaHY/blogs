We are excited to announce the release of our newest tutorial, A Technical Deep Dive on Liberty.

A Technical Deep Dive on Liberty is an end-to-end tutorial that walks you through how to develop and deploy cloud-native Java applications in Jakarta EE and MicroProfile. The tutorial is aimed at Java developers, from Liberty novices to those more experienced with writing applications to run on Liberty.

In A Technical Deep Dive on Liberty, you will learn how to:

* build a RESTful microservice on Liberty with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile 
* easily document your REST API for developers to consume your microservice
* externalize your configuration to make your application portable and easier to update
* persist data to a database 
* secure your application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) so that only authenticated and authorized applications can request information from your microservice
* add health checks to easily report the statuses of your microservice (for orchestration decision)
* provide metrics to monitor activity and performance of your application
* build a container image for your Java microservice
* deploy the container image to Kubernetes using the Open Liberty Operator
* test your applications easily with containers (for true-to-production testing)
