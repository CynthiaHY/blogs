[#admincenter]
== Admin Center 1.0

The Admin Center 1.0 feature provides a web-based GUI to help configure, manage, and monitor your running server, along with support for viewing and interacting with Java Batch jobs and OpenID Connect (OIDC) client and token management.

image::img/blog/ui_serverConfigTool2.png[ui serverConfigTool2 ,width=70%,align="center"]

In order to enable Admin Center, you'll need to add the adminCenter-1.0 feature, and an authorized user.  Since, for security reasons, Admin Center requires SSL, you'll also need to make sure you have configured the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/httpEndpoint.html[`httpsPort`] and link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/keyStore.html[`keyStore`].

For example:
[source, xml]
----
<server description="Admin Center example">

  <!-- Enable features -->
  <featureManager>
    <feature>adminCenter-1.0</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <!-- To access this server from a remote client add a host attribute to the following element, e.g. host=“*” -->
   <httpEndpoint id=“defaultHttpEndpoint”
         host=“*”
         httpPort=“9080”
         httpsPort=“9443" />


<! -- Define a user with Administrator role -->
<quickStartSecurity userName="admin" 
userPassword="adminpwd" />

  <keyStore id=“defaultKeyStore” password=“Liberty”/>
</server>
----

Once the server starts, you'll be able to access the Admin Center login page via https://host_name:port_number/adminCenter/ so if your loopback address is mapped to localhost, you would navigate to https://localhost:9443/adminCenter/ in your browser.

Stay tuned for a blog specifically regarding Admin Center which will showcase the various tools and functionality it provides.


[#ldapconnection]
== LDAP connection supports Kerberos authentication

LDAP bind operations are used to authenticate clients (and the users or applications behind them) to the directory server. This establishes an authorization identity that is used for subsequent operations that are processed on that connection, and specifies the LDAP protocol version that the client uses. Before this update, the `LdapRegistry` element supported binding either anonymously or by using simple authentication with a user (`bindDN`) and password (`bindPassword`). This update adds an option to bind to LDAP: GSSAPI/Kerberos. Kerberos is an authentication mechanism that allows a client to authenticate by a Key Distribution Center (KDC). In Open Liberty 21.0.0.4-beta,  you can use either a Kerberos credential cache (ccache) or a Kerberos keytab file.

To update an `LdapRegistry` to use the GSSAPI/Kerberos option, you can set the bind authentication mechanism type using the new `LdapRegistry` attribute, `bindAuthMechanism`:

[source, xml]
----
bindAuthMechanism="GSSAPI"
----

You also need the Kerberos principal or Service Principal Name:

[source, xml]
----
krb5Principal="user1@EXAMPLE.COM"
----

If you are using a Kerberos ticket cache also known as a credential cache or ccache, add the Kerberos ticket cache file name to the `LdapRegistry` with the new attribute, `krb5TicketCache`:

[source, xml]
----
krb5TicketCache="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5-user1.cc"
----

Set the Kerberos configuration file name (for example, krb5.conf or krb5.ini) using the Kerberos element:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>
----

If you are using a Kerberos keytab file, set the Kerberos keytab file name using the Kerberos element:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>
----

If the Kerberos configuration file is not defined in the Kerberos element, Open Liberty will attempt to resolve the configuration file location by using the JDK default locations.

For the Kerberos credentials, the locations are checked in the following order: the ticket cache (if provided), the configured keytab file, and finally the JDK default location.

The following example shows how to configure the `LdapRegistry` element using a Kerberos ticket cache and Kerberos config file:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>

<ldapRegistry id="LDAP" realm="SampleLdapADRealm" host="ldap_hostname" port="389" ignoreCase="true" baseDN="DC=example,DC=com" bindAuthMechanism="GSSAPI" krb5Principal="user1@EXAMPLE.COM" krb5TicketCache="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5-user1.cc" ldapType="Custom" />
----

The following example shows how to configure an LDAP Registry using a Kerberos keytab and Kerberos config file:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf" />

<ldapRegistry id="LDAP" realm="SampleLdapADRealm" host="ldap_hostname" port="389" ignoreCase="true" baseDN="DC=example,DC=com" bindAuthMechanism="GSSAPI" krb5Principal="user1@EXAMPLE.COM" ldapType="Custom" />
----

For more information on `LdapRegistry`, see the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/ldapRegistry-3.0.html[LDAP User Registry documentation].

To enable this new beta function in your app, pull the All Beta Features package and add the LDAP User Registry 3.0 feature to your `server.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>ldapRegistry-3.0</feature>
</featureManager>

[#mpContextPropagation]
== MicroProfile Context Propagation 1.2

MicroProfile Context Propagation is a standalone MicroProfile specification. MicroProfile Context Propagation enables you to create completion stages that behave deterministically with respect to thread context and leverages the autonomic tuning of the Open Liberty global thread pool for asynchronous dependent stages.

The 1.2 release of MicroProfile Context Propagation aligns with the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2021/03/19/microprofile40-open-liberty-21003.html[MicroProfile 4.0 platform], specifically addressing a difference in how link:{url-prefix}/blog/2021/03/31/microprofile-config-2.0.html[MicroProfile Config 2.0] treats empty value configuration properties. When using MicroProfile Config to specify an empty list of thread context types for MicroProfile Context Propagation to use as defaults, use a value of `None` rather than an empty value. An empty value in MicroProfile Config 2.0 indicates to override any lower ordinal config sources and instead use the built-in default value for the property.  For example, the combination of `mp.context.ManagedExecutor.cleared=None` and `mp.context.ManagedExecutor.propagated=Remaining` causes every context type to be propagated.

To enable the MicroProfile Context Propagation 1.2 feature, add the following to your server configuration:
[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpContextPropagation-1.2</feature>
  <!-- other features used by example code... -->
  <feature>servlet-4.0</feature>
  <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
  <feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

Example usage within a Servlet:
[source, java]
----
private ManagedExecutor executor;

public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
    executor = ManagedExecutor.builder()
                .propagated(ThreadContext.APPLICATION)
                .cleared(ThreadContext.ALL_REMAINING)
                .build();
}

public void destroy() {
    executor.shutdownNow();
}

public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
    ...
    executor.copy(unmanagedCompletionStage).thenAcceptAsync(value -> {
        // requires java:comp namespace of the application,
        DataSource ds = InitialContext.doLookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/ds");
        ...
    });
}

[#expandLocation]
=== expandLocation property for AutoExpand

With this enhancement users are now able to specify a expansion location (`expandLocation`) on the `applicationManager` configuration to be utilized when the `autoExpand` attribute is set to "true". As currently implemented, when an application is autoExpanded the default location for the expanded files are hard coded to `${server.config.dir}/apps/expanded/`.

Now with this enhancement in place, the users are able to configure that location to a new value on the `filesystem`. Thus for example:

`<applicationManager autoExpand="true" expandLocation="${server.config.dir}/myApps/" />` would result in the application being expanded at `${server.config.dir}/myApps/{appname}/`.

This enhancement gives users more flexibility regarding the location of their expanded applications.

[#requestTiming]
== Ability to control whether thread dumps are collected when a hung request is detected in the Request Timing feature

The Request Timing feature (`requestTiming-1.0`) provides diagnostic information when the duration of any request exceeds the configured threshold. It provides a way to monitor requests with respect to time. The feature can automatically detect slow and hung requests and provide detailed diagnostic information; warning messages, thread stacks, and the creation of thread dumps.

When a hung request is detected in the Request Timing feature, a warning message is written in the messages log file along with a dump of the events that happened during the request. Following that, a set of three thread dumps will be initiated, 1 minute apart. After the completion of the three thread dumps, further set of three thread dumps are created only if new requests are detected to be hanging.

Some operations teams do not want so many thread dumps to be generated due to performance overhead on requests that are known to be long. In previous Open Liberty releases, there was no option to disable the thread dumps from being generated.

You can now control whether the Request Timing feature collects thread dumps. By setting the **new** `enableThreadDumps` Request Timing server configuration attribute to false, thread dumps will not be created during hung requests. If the new server configuration attribute is set to true or not specified at all, thread dumps will still be created.
   
The new Request Timing server configuration attribute can be configured in your server.xml as follows:

[source, xml]
----
<requestTiming includeContextInfo="true" slowRequestThreshold="120s" hungRequestThreshold="10s" sampleRate="1" enableThreadDumps="false"></requestTiming>`
----


The `enableThreadDumps` server configuration attribute can also be used in embedded Request Timing sub-elements: 
`<servletTiming/>` or `<jdbcTiming/>`, as follows:

[source, xml]
----
<requestTiming includeContextInfo="true" slowRequestThreshold="120s" hungRequestThreshold="10s" sampleRate="1">
    <servletTiming appName="MyApp" servletName="MyServletApp" slowRequestThreshold="100s" hungRequestThreshold="5s" enableThreadDumps="false"/>
</requestTiming>`
----

NOTE: An embedded `<servletTiming/>` or `<jdbcTiming/>` configuration in the server.xml file overrides the configured slow and hung request threshold that are defined in `<requestTiming/>`.  

For more information on the Request Timing feature, please refer to the following documentations:
- link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/requestTiming-1.0.html[Open Liberty Documentation on requestTiming-1.0 feature]
- link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/requestTiming.html[Open Liberty Documentation on requestTiming Configuration]

[#JDBC]
== Automatic Cleanup of Leaked Connections

Liberty connection management is enhanced with the ability to automatically detect and close unsharable connections that are left open by the application across the end of a request.

Occasionally, application code might forget to close an unsharable connection that it obtains, which prevents the connection from being returned to the connection pool for use by other requests. Over time, these leaked connections can degrade performance and eventually exhaust the connection pool. Liberty connection management now has the ability to detect and automatically close these leaked connections to prevent this from happening.

To take advantage of this new capability, configure one of the Liberty features that leverages the `connectionManager` element. For example, JDBC:
[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
  <feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
  <!-- more features -->
</featureManager>
----

Configure your data sources and connection factories as usual, which automatically leverage the new capability (To disable it, configure `autoCloseConnections="false"` on a `<connectionManager>`).
[source, xml]
----
<dataSource id="DefaultDataSource">
  <connectionManager maxPoolSize="10"/>
  <jdbcDriver libraryRef="PostgreSQL"/>
  <properties.postgresql databaseName="TESTDB" serverName="localhost" portNumber="5432"/>
</dataSource>

<library id="PostgreSQL">
  <file name="/usr/local/postgresql/postgresql-42.2.18.jar"/>
</library>
----

[#SSO]
== Single Sign-On (SSO) LTPA and JWT support authentication filter>>

With this new enhancement users can now use the authentication filter to select which HTTP servlet request should use link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/appSecurity-3.0.html[LTPA] and link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/jwtSso-1.0.html[JWT] for the SSO authentications.

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A21004+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 21.0.0.4].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/16113[Shared Class Cache not generated on Windows]
+
The IBM/OpenJ9 JDK Shared Class Cache may not have been generated on Windows if `IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS/OPENJ9_JAVA_OPTIONS` was not set causing slower startup performance.  With this fix, a Shared Class Cache will be created at `<WLP_USER_DIR>/servers/.classCache` improving the startup performance.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/16054[HSTS Header not added on responses with 404 status]
+
In certain cases where the response is fully handled by the HTTP transport without invoking the WebContainer engine (e.g. a 404 response), the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (`HSTS`) header was improperly omitted from the response even though the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/webContainer.html[`addStrictTransportSecurityHeader`] was properly configured.  The HTTP transport's parsing of these properties now has new tracing, the HTTP transport will inspect the response and, when configured to do so, add the `HSTS` header if it is missing and if the scheme is 'https'. The `HTTPDispatcher=all` trace level can be used to see what the resulting header value will look like.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15989[Bump netty dependencies to 4.1.62.Final]
+
Although Open Liberty is not vulnerable, we've updated Netty (used by the link:{url-prefix}/docs/21.0.0.3/reference/feature/grpcClient-1.0.html[gRPC Client 1.0] feature) to 4.1.62.Final in order to pull in a fix for a CVE.
