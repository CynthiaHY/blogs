In version 23.0.0.3 and later, you can easily run a Spring Boot 3.x application from a WAR file on Open Liberty. This post uses the Spring Boot Petclinic sample application and the Liberty Maven plugin to create and run a WAR-based Spring Boot 3.1 application on Open Liberty.

== Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Open Liberty version 23.0.0.3 or later, with the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/servlet-6.0.html[Jakarta Servlet 6.0] (`servlet-6.0`) feature enabled in the `server.xml` file


== Getting started with the Spring Petclinic sample application

This tutorial uses the 3.1 release of the link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic[Spring Petclinic sample application].

To run this application on Open Liberty, you can add the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven[Liberty Maven plugin] to the existing Petclinic `pom.xml` file. You can also configure a package that runs the required `servlet-6.0` feature and other helpful features by default.

1. Clone the sample repository to your machine.
+
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git 
cd spring-petclinic
----

2. Edit the Petclinic `pom.xml` file to build the sample application from a WAR file by using the Liberty Maven plugin.
+
First, change the name of the sample from `petclinic` to `liberty-spring-petclinic` and add the `war` packaging type:
+
[source,xml]
----
<name>liberty-spring-petclinic</name>
<packaging>war</packaging>
----
+
Next, specify a WAR file name under the `build` section:
+
[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <finalName>liberty-${project.artifactId}</finalName>
----
+
And finally, under the `<build> <plugins>` section, add the Liberty Maven plugin:
+
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.8.1</version>
  <configuration>
      <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-webProfile10</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.5</version>
          <type>zip</type>
      </runtimeArtifact>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
This example specifies a recent version of the `webProfile10` package, which includes the required `servlet-6.0` feature.

3. Add the Servlet Initializer class to the Petclinic application under `/src/main/java` 
+
This class extends the `SpringBootServletInitializer` class and points to the sample Petclinic application.
+
[source,java]
----
PetClinicServletInitializer.java

    package org.springframework.samples.petclinic;

    import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder;
    import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitializer;

    public class PetClinicServletInitializer extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

        @Override
        protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {
            return application.sources(PetClinicApplication.class);
        }

    }
----

Now we are ready to compile and run!

== Compile and run the Petclinic sample application

1. Run maven clean to clear out any existing classes from a previous compile
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ./mvnw clean
----

2. Compile the project to ensure the initializer class looks good and that you were able to download all the necessary dependencies.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ./mvnw compile
----

3. Use the Liberty Maven plugin to define a "loose application" based on the sample application, which automatically deploys all the source and dependencies to Liberty. This command also downloads and starts the server.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ./mvnw liberty:run
----
+
Look for the sample application banner in the console:
+
[source,sh]
----

[INFO]  ==================================================================/_/_/_/
[INFO] 
[INFO] :: Built with Spring Boot :: 3.1.0
----

4. Test the application by visiting the following URL in a browser: http://localhost:9080/liberty-spring-petclinic/ 
 
5. When you finish testing the application, stop the server by running the following command:    
+
[source,sh]
----
$ ./mvnw liberty:stop
----

== Results

You ran a sample Spring Boot 3.x application from a WAR file on Open Liberty. These steps demonstrate a simple way to create and run any WAR file from an existing Spring Boot application on Liberty.
