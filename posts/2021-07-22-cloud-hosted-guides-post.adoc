//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

Our dedicated team of engineers have been hard at work creating new content for developers to enjoy. We now have 57 different guides on a range of topics through development, built, test and deploy so you as a developer can get started quickly and have a great experience with our tech. We now have a partnership with the IBM Skills Network team to bring you an even better experience by providing you with a full online development environment so that as a developer, you do not have to worry about pre-reqs and setting things up. We call these “cloud-hosted guides” and you can access them by going to one of our cloud enabled guides on our link:{url-prefix}/guides/[Open Liberty Guides site] and clicking the “Run in cloud” button in the topright as shown in the image below:

== What is the Skills Network and why are we using it with our guides?

The Skills Network is a learning environment that runs through a user’s browser. It runs in containers that are deployed to OpenShift in the IBM Cloud. This allows us not only to teach users how to build great cloud-native applications but also demonstrates that in practice with how the environment is deployed. Having control over every user’s environment means that we can create a place where the user can just get on with learning new skills rather than having to set things up locally.

The user has access to all the tools required to build cloud-native applications such as Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Maven, Gradle, OpenJ9 JVM and the Open Source Theia IDE which is based on VS Code and also runs in a container. 

== What guides are available in the Skills Network Environment?

We initially did a silent launch of 10 guides so that we could collect feedback and improve the system before going live. Now we have gone live we have 21 guides ready for you to try out:

== How to get started and navigate our new OL/SN portal

We have created a whole new portal specifically for the Open Liberty project that allows users to create an account, manage account information and launch into the Skills Network environment. There are many reasons that a user needs to be assigned to an account, but the main thing really is to avoid abuse of the environment as this is a free service and is intended for education purposes only.
The portal is quite straight forward to navigate so once you have clicked on the “Run in Cloud” button mentioned above you will be taken to a login page if you do not have an account or are not logged in. From here you can login or create a new account and we only require very limited information to get started. You can also use social logins to create an account and then use that later to login quickly.

Once you are logged in you will then be directed to the landing page for the guide you wish to learn. Simply click on the “access cloud-hosted guide” button and after a few minutes your Skills Network environment should be set-up and ready to use.

== The Basics of the Environment

The environment is quite easy to use with your instructions on the left and your IDE with a terminal on the right. Each guide has different steps with instructions that you can copy straight to your clipboard by clicking on the image:/img/blog/OL_Cloud-hosted-4.png[] button. You can change the font, font size and change the instructions from light to dark mode using the panel above the instructions frame. You can also resize the instruction and IDE frames to suit your screen by dragging on the edge of the frames. 

The IDE is very similar to VS Code and you can open new terminals by clicking on the terminal tab and selecting “New Terminal”. On the left of the IDE you have the projects button image:/img/blog/OL_Cloud-hosted-5.png[] that will allow you to navigate through your project and open files in the IDE, once you have cloned down the repo for the guide. Maven, Gradle, Docker and Kubernetes are all available for use in the terminal with their normal respective commands. 

Once you have finished a guide you need to log out using the account button in the top right hand corner so that next time you login you will have a clean environment otherwise it will clean-up after 30 minutes of inactivity. We would also love to get your feedback on the environment and information regarding how to do that can be found in the last step of the guides.

== Will there be more cloud-hosted guides?

Not only do we want to try and have all our guides on the Skills Network environment, but we are actively developing new guides all the time. Our guides have been really well-received so we’re not stopping at 57. We have a large backlog of proposed guides, some of which we’re already working on and are nearly ready to publish, on topic.

== Help us Help you

You’re welcome to propose new guides by raising an issue and writing an outline for consideration. Especially let us know if you can contribute in some way once the guide has been accepted, whether that’s by writing the guide, writing some code, or both.
If you see any errors in our existing guides on Skills Network or via the Open Liberty site, feel free to raise an issue against that guide’s GitHub repository (each guide has its own repository, which you can find in the guide text) or to create a PR to fix it.
In the meantime though, grab a hot drink and browse our 57+ guides. To stay up to date with our new guides, follow us on Twitter or bookmark new guides.
