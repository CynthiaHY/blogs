== What is a buildpack?

A buildpack is a set of executables that inspects your app source code and creates a plan to build and run your application.  

Paketo buildpacks are toolkits and workflows for building reproducible container images from source code.

The link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty[Paketo Cloud Native Liberty buildpack] provides the Open Liberty runtime to a workflow that produces an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image that can run just about anywhere.

== What do you need?
* Your application source

* link:https://hub.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community[Docker]

* The link:https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[pack CLI]

== Let's get started!

Download the Open Liberty starter app:
[source]
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git
cd guide-getting-started/start

Set a default builder:
[source]
pack config default-builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base

Build the app:
[source]
pack build myapp --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty

Your application now is ready to run. 

[source]

== Build your app from an on-prem Open Liberty installation
You can build from an on-prem Open Liberty installation by using a packaged Liberty server. Run the following command to package your server.
[source]
bin/server package defaultServer --include=usr

You can then supply the packaged server to the build by using the `--path` argument:
[source]
pack build --path <packaged-server-zip-path> --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty myapp 

Alternatively, you can build from a Liberty server installation by changing your working directory to the installation root that contains the `wlp` directory and running the following command:
[source]
pack build --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty myapp
