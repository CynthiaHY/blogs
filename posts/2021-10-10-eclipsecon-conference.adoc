https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021[EclipseCon] is back again as a free, virtual event! EclipseCon (25th-28th October) is a leading conference for developers, architects, and open source business leaders to learn about Eclipse technologies, share best practices, and more. It connects the Eclipse ecosystem and the industryâ€™s leading minds to explore common challenges and innovate together on open source runtimes, tools, and frameworks for cloud and edge applications, IoT, artificial intelligence, connected vehicles and transportation, digital ledger technologies, and much more.

If you're also going to be there, deciding which of the great talks to see at EclipseCon could prove to be challenging with so many fantastic sessions on offer. So we've put together a helpful summary of the sessions on https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile], https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE], https://openliberty.io/about/[Open Liberty] and https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[OpenJ9].

== Community Day at EclipseCon 2021

EclipseCon Community Day is on Monday, October 25 13:00 - 17:45 CET (the day before the start of the main EclipseCon conference). Community Day is focused on and around working groups and Eclipse projects. The content is organized by the community groups themselves, with logistical support provided by the conference team. Anyone who is registered for EclipseCon 2021 may participate in Community Day; no extra signup is required.

Here are two of the fantastic sessions being run by members of the Open Liberty team:

* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/microprofile-current-and-future[MicroProfile Current and Future]
+
In this session, MicroProfile lead https://twitter.com/emilyfhjiang[Emily Jiang] is going to bring you up to date with the latest MicroProfile news and then briefly discuss the future roadmap for MicroProfile. Come along to this session to listen, ask questions and find out more about MicroProfile's contunued innovation and transformation.

* eclipsecon.org/2021/jakarta-rest-looking-ahead[Jakarta REST - Looking Ahead]
+
In this session, Jakarta REST lead https://twitter.com/AndrewMcCright[Andrew McCright] will intorduce Jakarta RESTful Web Services (a.k.a. JAX-RS) - one of the more active and popular APIs in the Jakarta EE family. He'll also explore the future of this Jakarta EE component to see how these APIs will evolve and how you can contribute. This session will also leave time for interactive Q&A, so bring questions, ideas, complaints, and other feedback with you.


== Talks at EclipseCon 2021

A selection of MicroProfile, Jakarta EE, Open Liberty and OpenJ9 sessions:

Tuesday 26th::
* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/optimizing-java-workloads-containers-and-hybrid-cloud-deployments[Optimizing Java Workloads for Containers and Hybrid Cloud Deployments]
+
Open J9's Vijay Sundaresan and https://twitter.com/mstoodle[Mark Studley] will review these latest innovation available to Java users, including Virtual Machine technologies (e.g., in Eclipse OpenJ9) to optimize Java workloads for containers and cloud. They'll delve into how these innovations benefit cloud-native runtimes (e.g., Open Liberty), and discuss how you can adopt them to optimize your cloud-native Java application and microservice deployments for performance (e.g., fast startup and throughput), efficiency (e.g., memory footprint and consumption) and hence, cost savings.

* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/powering-java-azure-open-liberty-and-openshift[Powering Java on Azure with Open Liberty and OpenShift]
+
https://twitter.com/gcharters[Graham Charters] will team up with Microsoft's Principal Architect https://twitter.com/edburns[Edward Burns] to lead this fast-paced hands-on workshop, where you'll see first-hand how to run Java EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications on Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO). The combination of ARO with Open Liberty offers a powerful and flexible platform for your enterprise Java applications. 

* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/equipping-next-generation-open-source-developers[Equipping the Next Generation of Open-Source Developers]
+
Open Source has become the defacto way to build software. So, how and what are we doing in enabling the next-generation of up-and-coming developers to participate in open-source software development? Join Open Liberty's https://twitter.com/yeekangc[YK Chang] and https://twitter.com/gcharters[Kathryn Kodama] and Karim Ali and Jeff Cho as they take a look at the Canada Open-Source Projects (CANOSP) program, its experience and successes, and what they have learned from it in promoting and advocating for Open Source and equipping university and college students to participate in open-source software development.


Wednesday 27th::
* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/instant-java-cloud-applications-checkpoint-and-restore[Instant On Java Cloud Applications with Checkpoint and Restore]
+
Thomas Watson will discuss a different approach to achieve "Instant On" for Java applications using Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU).  CRIU is a feature available on Linux that enables a snapshot of a running application to be taken.  This snapshot can then be restored very quickly from the point the snapshot was taken and resume serving the application users. This session will alo include a demo of using this approach with OpenJ9 and Open Liberty in a (Docker) container image.


Thursday 28th::
* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/microprofile-40-and-beyond[MicroProfile 4.0 and beyond]
+
Java Champion https://twitter.com/emilyfhjiang[Emily Jiang] will discuss how MicroProfile has evolved to become a standard body for developing cloud-native APIs. She'll bring you up to date with the new features in MicroProfile 4.0 with a live demo and briefly discuss what is next for this open source project. Come to this session to get yourself updated with the latest news on MicroProfile.

* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/replicating-production-your-laptop-using-magic-containers[Replicating production on your laptop using the magic of containers]
+
https://twitter.com/gracejansen27[Grace Jansen] introduces the concept of test containers within this session and delves into why utilising containers to test our cloud-native applications can enable us to ensure our tests are replicating our production environment as closely as possible. She'll demo live how Testcontainers can help you run and test with true-to-production environments in development with minimal re-writing of your test code.

* https://www.eclipsecon.org/2021/sessions/microprofile-graphql-and-jpa-meant-each-other[MicroProfile GraphQL and JPA: Meant for each other]
+
In this session, Open Liberty's https://twitter.com/AndrewMcCright[Andrew McCright] will discuss and demo how you can rapidly build data-driven microservices using MicroProfile GraphQL - a tool that makes it simple to create Java-based GraphQL services with a few annotations. This session will demonstrate the power and simplicity of making a relational database accessible as in a service or cloud-native environment.



=== Here's a couple of talks about broader Java topics that may also be of interest:
