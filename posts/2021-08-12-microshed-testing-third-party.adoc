//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// Above:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines above.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appriopriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace POST_URL with the URL of the blog post to which this post will redirect visitors.
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Do not provide any body text in this post - it will not be displayed.

// Example post: 2020-04-29-fast-setup-java-microservice-microprofile-starter.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark
// backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
