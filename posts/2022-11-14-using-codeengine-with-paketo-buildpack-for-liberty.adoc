You can use link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine[IBM Cloud Code Engine] to easily deploy Java applications by using the link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/04/01/cloud-native-liberty-buildpack.html[Paketo Buildpack for Liberty] with your container images or source code.

This post provides instructions on how to use the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty with Code Engine. To learn more about using Code Engine, see link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-getting-started[Getting started with IBM Cloud Code Engine].

IBM Cloud announced the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-deprecation[deprecation] of Cloud Foundry.
Code Engine provides the next level of easy application deployment and mature management of critical business applications in IBM Cloud.  Move your applications from the Cloud Foundry liberty-for-java buildpack to a cloud native solution using Code Engine and the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty.

== What do you need?
* An https://www.ibm.com/cloud[IBM Cloud] Account
* Your application source

To deploy container images, you'll also need:

* The link:https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[pack CLI]
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] or https://podman.io[Podman]. This post focuses on Docker. 
* An externally accessible container registry that can host your images.

For details on deploying your application from repository source code from the Code Engine console, see  link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code#deploy-app-source-code[Code Engine console].

For details on deploying your application from repository source code with the CLI, see  link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code#deploy-app-source-code-cli[CLI].

== Code Engine build strategies
Code Engine can build your container from source with link:https://paketo.io[Paketo buildpacks] using the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build#build-buildpack-strat[Cloud Native Buildpacks] build strategy. The Paketo Buildpack for Liberty is included in the composite Paketo Buildpack for Java that also includes `tomcat` and `tomee` application servers. Tomcat is the default application server and to use Open Liberty requires a little extra configuration.

You can set the application server that the Paketo Buildpack for Java uses by specifying the `BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER` environment variable. If this variable is undefined, the order of Java application servers in the buildpack dictates which one will be picked. Normally, environment variables are provided to buildpacks by using the `--env` parameter on the `pack build` CLI command. However, Code Engine does not use `pack,` so the environment variables must be provided in a `.buildenv` file in the application's root source directory.

== Let's get started

Create the `.buildenv` file in the application's root source directory. At a minimum, `.buildenv` should contain `BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty` but can contain other environment variables consumed by buildpacks.
```
BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty
```

Log in to the IBM Cloud console and head to the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview[Code Engine overview] page.  When you are building from source, enter the URL of the repository that hosts your source and click **Start creating **.

image:/img/blog/code_engine_overview.png[IBM Cloud Code Engine Overview,align="center"]

On the **Start creating** page, you must enter `9080` as the value for `Listening port`.

image:img/blog/code_engine_start_creating.png[Start creating,width=70%,align="center"]

In the **Runtime settings** section, we recommend setting the minimum number of instances to `1`.
[.img_border_light]
image:img/blog/code_engine_min_instances.png[Minimum instances,width=70%,align="center"]

Click **Specify build details**.
In this example, the source root that contains the `.buildenv` file is the `finish` directory.

image:/img/blog/code_engine_git_repo.png[Root of the application's source directory,width=70%,align="center]

Click **Next** and select **Cloud Native Buildpack** as the source.  Click **Next**.
[.img_border_light]
image:/img/blog/code_engine_build_strategy.png[Build strategy,align="center"]

Enter the details of where Code Engine will store your image and click **Done**.

Click **Create** to have Code Engine create and deploy your application.

The `Build step details` output will show the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty contributed to the image.

Similarly, if you're creating your application from source using the Code Engine CLI you need to specify the `port` and build strategy along with the `.buildenv` file present in the application source root directory:

  $ ibmcloud ce app create --name MYAPPNAME --image REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY --registry-secret SECRET --build-source . --strategy buildpacks --port 9080

```
[finish (prod=)]$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x   7 kevin  staff   224 Oct 28 14:54 .
drwxr-xr-x  12 kevin  staff   384 Oct 19 11:07 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff    26 Nov  4 12:53 .buildenv
-rw-r--r--   1 kevin  staff   790 Oct 19 11:07 Dockerfile
-rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff  4066 Oct 19 11:07 pom.xml
drwxr-xr-x   4 kevin  staff   128 Oct 19 11:07 src
drwxr-xr-x  11 kevin  staff   352 Oct 20 08:53 target
```

.To summarize, two important configuration steps are required to use the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty in Code Engine:
. Create a `.buildenv` file that defines the  `BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty` environment variable.
. Set the listening port to 9080

== Other environment variables you can set in the `.buildenv` file
BP_LIBERTY_INSTALL_TYPE::
Specifies the  link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#install-types[Install type] of Liberty. Open Liberty (value of `ol`) is the default.

BP_LIBERTY_PROFILE::
Specifies which liberty profile to install. Valid profiles for Liberty are documented link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#profiles[in the buildpacks documentation].

BP_LIBERTY_FEATURES::
Specifies a space-separated list of Liberty features to be installed with the Liberty runtime. Supports any valid Liberty feature.

== Taking full advantage of all what the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty has to offer
Code Engine doesn't use the `pack build` CLI to create container images. It plugs into the cloud native buildpack's lifecycle natively. As a result, some features of the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty are not easily available to Code Engine. Features like link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty/blob/main/docs/installing-ifixes.md[installing iFixes], link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#using-custom-features[custom features], and installing from a link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#building-from-a-packaged-server[packaged server] or link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#building-from-a-liberty-server[server directory] aren't available when you use Code Engine to create the container image.

For these features, you can use the `pack build` CLI to create the container image, push the image to an external container registry. Then, use Code Engine to deploy and manage your container by pulling your container image from the container registry from the Code Engine console or CLI.
