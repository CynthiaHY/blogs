= Finding the Liberty fixpack from a GitHub issue

Liberty developers sometimes run into problems for which they find a matching issue in GitHub that addresses the problem that they are experiencing. You can use the information in Liberty GitHub issues to dtermine which Liberty fix packs contain a fix for the problems described in the issue.

Once you've found the right GitHub issue for a problem, the next challenge is figuring out which Liberty fix packs contain the fix for the problem detailed in the issue.

There are at least three methods for finding this information:

1. If the GitHub issue has the `release bug` label, you might find the issue in the https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/fix-list-ibm-websphere-application-server-liberty-continuous-delivery[Fix list for IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty - Continuous Delivery], which lists the Git issues that are addressed in each Liberty fix pack. Although this list applies to WebSphere Liberty, the corresponding fix pack number for Open Liberty contains the same updates, provided the function exists in Open Liberty.
** If the `release bug` label was added to an issue before the first fix pack for that issue was delivered, the issue is in the fix list.
** Some issues that have the `release bug` label might not be in the fix list. In these cases, the label was added after its fix pack was delivered and the issue was not manually added to the fix list.
2. Find the fix pack information in the `release:yynnn` issue label.
** If the `release bug` label was added to an issue before its first fix pack was delivered, the `release:yynnn` label might not appear on the issue.
** Developers might add the `release:yynnn` label to an issue after fix pack delivery.
3. Find the fix pack information in the last commit in the last pull request for the issue.
** If you cannot find the issue in the fix list and there is no `release:yynnn` label, you can use this method.

== Finding the fix pack for a 'release bug' issue

Suppose that you have found the following issue, https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14975[14975 OIDC RP: creating a subject with allowCustomCachKey=false results in a subject that includes a cache key], which matches a problem that you are experiencing.

* When you view the issue, you'll see the following labels in the Labels list:
+
image::img/blog/finding_14975_a.png[align="left"]
+
* The following two labels are important here:
[start=1]
. The `release bug` label is in the issue, therefore the issue should appear in the fix list.
. The `release:21001` label is on the issue. This means that the fix for this issue should be first available in 21.0.0.1.

=== Let's verify the **release:21001** label:

. Navigate to https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/fix-list-ibm-websphere-application-server-liberty-continuous-delivery[Fix list for IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty - Continuous Delivery]
. Search for **14975**:
+

+
. Scroll up to find the fix pack that contains the issue:

== Finding the fix pack for a non-'release bug' issue

Suppose that you have found the following issue, https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15987[15987 OIDC state cookie cannot be read by another JVM in collective w/socal login TS004966274], which matches a problem that you are experiencing.

* When you view the issue, you'll see the following labels in the Labels list:
+
image::img/blog/finding_15987_a.png[align="left"]
+
* Take note of the following two things here:
. The `release bug` label is not in the issue, therefore the issue does not appear in the fix list.
. The `release:21004` label is on the issue. This means that the fix for this issue was first available in 21.0.0.4.

When you don't see the `release bug` label on an issue, you most likely won't see a `release:yynnn` label either.  Don't assume that the issue that you are looking at isn't in a fix pack just because you do not see the `release:yynnn` label. If the issue is closed, it should be in a shipped or future fix pack. You can find the fix pack for the issue from the from the last commit in the last pull request for the issue.

=== Let's verify the **release:21004** label:

. Navigate to the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15987[15987] issue on GitHub.
. Find the pull request (PR) that fixes the issue, for this issue, it is https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/16150[16150]
+
image::img/blog/finding_15987_b.png[align="left"]
+
** If the PR is not Merged, then the fix for the issue is not delivered yet.
. Click on the link for PR https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/16150[#16150]
. Search the text of the PR for `revert "`
** That is: revert, space, double quote
** Look for a revert message that is similar to the following example:name: value
+
image::img/blog/finding_revert_1.png[align="left"]
+
** If you find that the PR has been reverted, you cannot follow the rest of these simple steps for your issue. For more information, see <<#revert,Finding the fix pack for a PR that is reverted>>

. Click on the **Commits** tab
+
image::img/blog/finding_16150_a.png[align="left"]
+
. Click on the last commit for the PR (in this PR, there is only one): https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/16150/commits/843c128b3d0ceb1e9ec0fd1985edb16d2a2145f8[843c128]
+
image::img/blog/finding_16150_b.png[align="left"]
+
. In the Commits tab, look for a list of release tags that indicates in which releases this PR was included, starting from the newest to oldest. The last tag in the list is the first release in which the PR was included; in this case it is **gm-21.0.0.4**:
+
image::img/blog/finding_16150_c.png[align="left"]
+
** If no fix packs are listed, then the issue has not yet been delivered in a fix pack.

== Finding the fix pack for a PR that is reverted

When you try to find the fix pack for an issue, you might run into a PR that is reverted. A reverted PR can be much more challenging to track. You need to find another PR that re-introduces the fix that was reverted. You can sometimes determine this information by searching in a PR for a re-introduce message that identifies an issue that re-introduces the reverted changes.

When a PR has been reverted, you might see a pair of updates in the PR that look like the following example:

image::img/blog/finding_revert_2.png[align="left"]

In some cases, you can follow a chain of revert PRs and re-introduce issues until you end up with a commit in a PR that was successfully merged. In the PR that was reverted, click on the 'Re-introduce change' issue and repeat the procedure that was described previously.

However, this method is dependent on developers properly associating the PRs that re-introduce the updates to the re-introduce issue. This does not always happen and you can end up at a dead-end, with the appearance that the issue was never re-merged, when in fact it was. Therefore, if you follow the revert and re-introduce chain and it results in success, you can count on the results. However, if you encounter a dead-end, the issue might or might not be resolved.
