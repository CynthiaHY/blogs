[#pkjwt]
== Private Key JWT authentication support for OpenID Connect clients
OpenID Connect clients in Liberty now support the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method with OpenID Connect token endpoints. 

OpenID Connect clients are required to provide authentication data to the OpenID Connect provider when they invoke the provider's token endpoint. Clients can authenticate using several different methods, but most of those methods require a client secret. The new `private_key_jwt` authentication method enables clients to use asymmetric keys to create signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate instead of client secrets. OpenID Connect clients using this authentication method are no longer required to have a client secret.

Server administrators can enable this functionality using the new `private_key_jwt` option for the `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` attribute, as well as the new `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` and `keyAliasName` attributes in either the `openidConnectClient` or `oidcLogin` elements in their `server.xml` file.

For example, when you use the OpenID Connect Client feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>openidConnectClient-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <openidConnectClient tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" keyAliasName="privatekeyaliasRS512" ... />
----

 If you are using the Social Media Login feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <oidcLogin tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm="E512" keyAliasName="privatekeyaliasES512" ... />
----

The `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` attribute specifies the signing algorithm to sign the JWT that is used for client authentication. The `keyAliasName` attribute points to the key to use to sign the JWT.

For more information about the configuration options, refer to the docs for the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element] and the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element]. 

For more information about `private_key_jwt` client authentication, refer to the link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OpenID Connect core specification] and link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523[RFC 7523].

[#pkce]
== PKCE support for OpenID Connect clients
OpenID Connect clients in Open Liberty now support Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) (RFC 7636). PKCE is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 specification that provides protection from authorization code interception attacks for OAuth 2.0 public clients. In very specific scenarios, a malicious application can intercept an authorization code intended for a legitimate OAuth 2.0 public client and use the authorization code to obtain access and ID tokens on behalf of the client. PKCE introduces additional steps and request parameters to prevent such interception attacks.

Server administrators can enable this functionality using the `pkceCodeChallengeMethod` attribute in either the `<openidConnectClient>` or `<oidcLogin>` elements in their `server.xml`.

For example, when you use the OpenID Connect Client feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>openidConnectClient-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <openidConnectClient pkceCodeChallengeMethod="S256" ... />
----

 If you are using the Social Media Login feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <oidcLogin pkceCodeChallengeMethod="S256" ... />
----

For more information about the configuration options, refer to the docs for the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element] and the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element]. . 
For more information about PKCE,  refer to link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[RFC 7636].

=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 20, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.6-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta Data beta 2, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta-data-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-b2</version>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.6-beta,)'
}
----

Or if you're using link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/container-images.html[container images]:

[source]
----
FROM icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:beta
----

Or take a look at our link:{url-prefix}/downloads/#runtime_betas[Downloads page].

For more information on using a beta release, refer to the link:{url-prefix}docs/latest/installing-open-liberty-betas.html[Installing Open Liberty beta releases] documentation.
