1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to? 
    
    Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): OpenID Connect Client 1.0, Social Media Login 1.0
   
    Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0):  openidConnectClient-1.0, socialLogin-1.0
   
   
    </GHA-BLOG-RELATED-FEATURES>

    <GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.  
    Server admins.
    
    </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
   
    <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?  
    
    OpenID Connect clients in Open Liberty now support the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method with OpenID Connect token endpoints. OpenID Connect clients are required to provide authentication data to the OpenID Connect provider when invoking the provider's token endpoint. Clients can authenticate using several different methods, but most of those methods require a client secret. The new `private_key_jwt` authentication method allows clients to make use of asymmetric keys to create signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate instead of client secrets. OpenID Connect clients in Open Liberty using this authentication method are no longer required to have a client secret.

    Server administrators can enable this functionality using the new `private_key_jwt` option for the `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` attribute, as well as the new `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` and `keyAliasName` attributes in either the `<openidConnectClient>` or `<oidcLogin>` elements:
    ```XML
    <openidConnectClient tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" keyAliasName="privatekeyaliasRS512" ... />
    <oidcLogin tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm="E512" keyAliasName="privatekeyaliasES512" ... />
    ```

    The `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` attribute specifies the signing algorithm to use to sign the JWT used for client authentication. The `keyAliasName` attribute points to the key to use to sign the JWT.

    More information about the Liberty configuration options can be found in the docs for the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element] and the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element]. More information about `private_key_jwt` client authentication can be found in the link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OpenID Connect core specification] and link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523[RFC 7523].

   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?  
    
    OpenID Connect clients in Open Liberty now support Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) (RFC 7636). PKCE is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 specification that provides protection from authorization code interception attacks for OAuth 2.0 public clients. In very specific scenarios, a malicious application can intercept an authorization code intended for a legitimate OAuth 2.0 public client and use the authorization code to obtain access and ID tokens on behalf of the client. PKCE introduces additional steps and request parameters to prevent such interception attacks.

    Server administrators can enable this functionality using the `pkceCodeChallengeMethod` attribute in either the `<openidConnectClient>` or `<oidcLogin>` elements:
    ```XML
    <openidConnectClient pkceCodeChallengeMethod="S256" ... />
    <oidcLogin pkceCodeChallengeMethod="S256" ... />
    ```

    More information about the Liberty configuration options can be found in the docs for the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element] and the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element]. More information about PKCE can be found in link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[RFC 7636].

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----

----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
// https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html
// // // // // // // //

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.6-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.6-beta,)'
}
