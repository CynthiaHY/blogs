OpenID Connect clients in Liberty now support the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method with OpenID Connect token endpoints.

OpenID Connect clients are required to provide authentication data to the OpenID Connect provider when they invoke the providerâ€™s token endpoint. Clients can authenticate using several different methods, but most of those methods require a client secret. The `private_key_jwt` authentication method enables clients to use asymmetric keys to create signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate instead of client secrets. OpenID Connect clients using this authentication method are no longer required to have a client secret.

Server administrators can enable this functionality using the `private_key_jwt` option for the `tokenEndpointAuthMethod` attribute, as well as the `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` and `keyAliasName` attributes in either the `openidConnectClient` or `oidcLogin` elements in their server.xml file.

For example, when you use the OpenID Connect Client feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

```XML
    <featureManager>
        <feature>openidConnectClient-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <openidConnectClient tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" keyAliasName="privateKeyJwtAliasRS512" ... />
```

If you are using the Social Media Login feature, include configuration similar to the following example:

```XML
    <featureManager>
        <feature>socialLogin-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <oidcLogin tokenEndpointAuthMethod="private_key_jwt" tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm="E512" keyAliasName="privateKeyJwtAliasES512" ... />
```

The `tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlgorithm` attribute specifies the signing algorithm to sign the JWT that is used for client authentication. The `keyAliasName` attribute points to the key to use to sign the JWT, and must also be the alias for the public key that corresponds to the private key. The private key must be in the keystore that is specified by the SSL configuration that is referenced by `sslRef` in the OIDC client configuration. The public key must be in one of the following: the truststore that is specified by the `trustStoreRef` attribute, the truststore that is specified by the SSL configuration that is referenced by `sslRef`, or the keystore that is specified by the SSL configuration that is referenced by sslRef.

For more information about the configuration options, refer to the docs for the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/openidConnectClient.html[openidConnectClient element] and the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/oidcLogin.html[oidcLogin element].

For more information about private_key_jwt client authentication, refer to the link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OpenID Connect core specification] and link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523[RFC 7523].

== Notable bugs fixed in this release


Weâ€™ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If youâ€™re interested, hereâ€™s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A23009+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 23.0.0.9].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25978[The SPI for registering CDI extensions and Beans will scan the entire archive without an extension]
+
If the SPI for registering CDI extensions is used, the archive it is in will be treated as a normal CDI archive, which defaults to bean scanning mode "annotated" unless there is an extension in the bundle. This means that a class in the bundle with a bean defining annotation will become a bean even if it is not registered via the SPI.

+

+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25927[CWWKS1706E + CWWKS1739E errors occurs when minimal jwks data is provided by Identity Provider]
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25866[Unexpected end of file from server]
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25834[OpenLiberty 23.0.0.7 with webProfile-8.0 logs messages saying it requires annotations in the jakarta.annotation namespace]
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25782[Calling stop on an already stopped server hangs for 30 seconds and then reports an error on WSL]
+
If you stop a server, and then attempt to stop it again, the command hangs and eventually reports an error, exiting with code `21`.
In version `22.0.0.13` the error was reported immediately, in `23.0.0.1` onwards the command waits for some time before erroring.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25743[The shutdown order between CDI and EJB is not enforced]
+

According to the [CDI spec](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0.html#startup_event): `jakarta.enterprise.event.Shutdown is not after @BeforeDestroyed(ApplicationScoped.class)`
+
EJBs can be ApplicationScoped and those beans will fire their BeforeDestroyed event when the EJB container shuts down. Thus, to adhere to the above spec CDI must shutdown before EJB and fire its jakarta.enterprise.event.Shutdown event "not after" EJB shuts down.
+
Currently the order between those components shutting down is not enforced, and determined by OSGi. 
+
To make matters more complicated the test `observeEjbPreDestroy` in `dev/io.openliberty.cdi.4.0.internal_fat/fat/src/io/openliberty/cdi40/internal/fat/startupEvents/ear/ejb/EjbApplicationScopedBean.java` was checking for the opposite behaviour. Recently this [test started failing](https://wasrtc.hursley.ibm.com:9443/jazz/web/projects/WS-CD#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=296455) alerting us to the problem. 
+
To resolve this we must add a service ranking to CDI so it will always shut down after EJB, and update the test so it checks for the correct behaviour. 

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25291[Return 400 status for invalid URI]
