[#Intro]

=== What is microprofile and OpenLiberty
The link:https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile] specification consists of a collection of Enterprise Java APIs and technologies that together form a core baseline for microservices that aims to deliver application portability across multiple runtimes.

link:https://openliberty.io/?_ga=2.75178834.1545551050.1658778682-1210051418.1658778682[Open Liberty] is a lightweight open source Javaâ„¢ runtime that is built by using modular features. link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty[WebSphere Liberty] is a commercial version of Open Liberty.

=== About Microprofile config
Parameter values directly written in the code file as constants are not an acceptable coding standard anymore, instead, all the parameter instances are externalized in different formats (.java, .properties, .xml), either create a 'constant' files of any format separately from the source code and read values directly from it or by creating variables in the code and feeding values to it from the environment variable on run time from the hosted environment. 

Microprofile and OpenLiberty have standardized the use of these parameter files with additional properties like ordianls. Different type of files where the parameter values and variable (constants and run time type) can be hosted are 

    1. server.xml
    2. Environment variables
    3. microprofile-config.properties
    4. bootstrap.properties
    5. server.env
    6. CustomConfig properties (anything which implement org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource)

Applications need to be hosted on multiple environments for various purposes and hence there is a requirement to design applications with run time parameters. Various types of configuration files are used to inject parameters into applications on run time. When application configurations are modified at run time, applications may or may not be required to be restarted for the changes to be in effect in application. We are discussing about these configurations files in this blog. Different configuration options available in Open Liberty applications hosted on containerized environment are  


All these property files contains an ordinal value to set the reading order of the file by the application.

== Different Data injection methods in Kubernetes/OpenShift

There are multiple ways with which you can inject 
PODS can define environment variables directly in the pod defenition yaml configuration and application code can use it. Any change in environment variables will need a pod restart for the change to take effect in the code.
