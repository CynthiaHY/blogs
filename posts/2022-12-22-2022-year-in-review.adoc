Open Liberty, a modern, secure, cloud-native Java runtime, link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/09/21/history-maker-projects.html[celebrated its 5th birthday] in October. As many people are aware, though, Liberty's roots are longer established: in 2017, IBM open-sourced its  WebSphere Liberty Java runtime as the Open Liberty project. WebSphere Liberty, which in turn celebrated its 10th birthday in June this year, continues to be built from the open source Open Liberty codebase and you can pay for link:https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-liberty[production support from IBM] (in addition to link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-liberty[free community support]), whether you're running Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty.

The Open Liberty developers are significant contributors to the Java community, in particular to the MicroProfile and Jakarta EE projects. Open Liberty itself is a link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/12/07/relicense-eplv2-proposal.html[compatible implementation of the MicroProfile and Jakarta EE specifications] and is used by those projects to finalise the specifications.

As you can see, Open Liberty has a long history and is still going strong, so we'll take a look back at what's been happening this year to see how 2022 sets up Liberty as a cloud-native Java runtime in 2023 and beyond.

== Fast startup, without compromise, for cloud-native Java applications

A clutch of related releases throughout 2022 coalesced into the beta of Liberty InstantOn in September. Liberty InstantOn enables Java applications in the cloud to start quickly while still running on the JVM, which is not otherwise known for its fast startup but generally recognised as performing well in production because of its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

In June, IBM Semeru Runtimes (link:https://adoptium.net/marketplace/[a free Java distribution of OpenJ9 JVM with OpenJDK] that is a good match for link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/08/19/open-liberty-semeru-performance.html[using with Open Liberty]) released the Semeru Cloud Compiler. The Semeru Cloud Compiler link:https://developer.ibm.com/articles/jitserver-optimize-your-java-cloud-native-applications/[decouples the JIT compiler from the JVM] to prevent your Java application suffering possible negative effects due to CPU and memory consumption caused by JIT compilation in the JVM. The JIT compiler is one of the culprits causing the JVM to be slow to start, so decoupling the two to run in separate threads enabled the JVM to run more quickly.

In September, Liberty beta'd its InstantOn technology, which was a collaboration between the OpenJ9 and Open Liberty development teams. With InstantOn, at build time, you can take a snapshot (a checkpoint) of your Java application after it has done the laborious parts of startup, then save that snapshot in your container image to deploy into production. When the containerized application is started, it skips the startup process that was completed before the snapshot was taken, making it much faster (up to 10x) to run the application. Inconsistencies between the checkpoint and restore environments, such as time, or saved data that could cause insecurities, such as security tokens, are handled by the JVM.

The best way to try out InstantOn is by using link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/09/29/instant-on-beta.html[Liberty InstantOn] which shields the application developer from the complexities of how checkpoint/restore works in the JVM. If you have any feedback, link:https://groups.io/g/openliberty[let us know on our mailing list]. As usual, if you hit a problem, link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/open-liberty[post a question on StackOverflow], or if you hit a bug, link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues[please raise an issue].

== Liberty Tools to enhance your developer experience in your preferred IDE

In August, we link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/08/01/liberty-tools-eclipse.html[introduced the new Liberty Tools for Eclipse IDE], which provide support for writing applications that use the MicroProfile EE APIs and for configuring the Liberty server on which the application will run. The Liberty Tools also support running your application in dev mode (for easy iterative compilation and testing) and a dashboard for managing your projects. We then link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/11/04/liberty-tools-eclipse-jakarta-ls.html[added Jakarta EE support] to that in November.

image::img/blog/liberty-tools-eclipse-jakarta-snippet.gif[Adding Jakarta EE code snippets to your code.,width=70%,align="center"]


The Liberty Tools are currently still in early release phases but the support in them is progressing well. This month, we have just released (NOT UNTIL END OF NEXT WEEK I THINK!) another early release refresh of the Liberty Tools but this time across all three main Java IDEs: link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse[Eclipse IDE], link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-vscode[Visual Studio Code], and link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-intellij[IntelliJ IDEA].

You might be wondering how the Liberty Tools relate to what you've maybe used previously in those IDEs to write Liberty applications. The Liberty Tools make use of Language Server technologies so that we can more easily support Liberty server configuration and APIs such as link:https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4mp[MicroProfile] and link:https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4jakarta[Jakarta EE] in standard ways across IDEs. If you have previously used the Liberty support in VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA, the existing dev mode integration capabilities in those IDEs are being built on with support for more things, like configuring the Liberty server, and writing MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications. If you have previously used the Liberty support in the open source (and similarly-named) link:{url-prefix}/start/#eclipse_developer_tools[Open Liberty Tools for Eclipse] (link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-tools[an open source project] that we released in 2017 from the codebase of IBM's long-support WebSphere Developer Tools), the new Liberty Tools take, refresh, and update those capabilities then add support for more things, such as MicroProfile and Jakarta EE.

== Java standards support in the Liberty runtime

Liberty supports MicroProfile 5.0 and Jakarta EE 9.1. We are currently working hard to complete the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/12/06/22.0.0.13-beta.html[support for MicroProfile 6.0 and Jakarta EE 10]; you can see our progress on both in our link:{url-prefix}/blog/?search=beta&key=tag[4-weekly Open Liberty beta releases].

In 2022, we also released support in Liberty for link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/04/12/java18-22004.html[Java SE 18 (in April)] and support for link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/10/25/22.0.0.11.html[Java SE 19 (in October)].

You can try out Liberty's MicroProfile 5.0 and Jakarta EE 9.1 support without installing anything by using our link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/04/12/guides-updated-mp5-jakartaee9.html[cloud-hosted guides].

== Events in 2022

And finally, if you're active on the Java and open source development circuit, you may have seen present or met up with some of us this year. 

image::img/blog/devadvocates.png[Liberty developer advocates headshots,width=70%,align="center"]

YK, Grace, Rich, and Jamie have travelled far and wide, as well as virtually, to conferences and Java user groups, and appeared on various tech podcasts.

They were joined by various members of the Liberty and OpenJ9 development teams depending on their location.

And the Space Rover team launched their shiny new Space Rover at various locations around the world, including Atlanta, Texas, Chicago, UK, and Ireland.

== Looking ahead: whatâ€™s happening in 2023?

While nothing in an Open Liberty beta is ever guaranteed to make it to GA release status (not least because your feedback could cause us to revise our plans), our betas are usually a good indicator of where we're currently intending to go in the near-ish future. So link:{url-prefix}/blog/?search=beta&key=tag[keep an eye on our beta releases], including Liberty InstantOn, MicroProfile 6.0 support, and Jakarta EE 10 support; let us know if you try them and what you think. Also have a go with the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/12/19/2022-12-19-cloud-native-java-development-with-liberty-tools.adoc[early releases of Liberty Tools in your preferred IDE]. **CHECK LINK BEFORE PUBLISHING** and send us your thoughts. Then watch for link:{url-prefix}/blog/?search=release&search!=beta[our GA releases], which are typically every 4 weeks.
