[#graphql]
=== MicroProfile GraphQL 2.0

MicroProfile GraphQL 2.0 incorporates Jakarta EE 9.1 dependencies.  This allows developers to continue using the same functionality provided by MP GraphQL 1.0 but with the updated Jakarta features such as link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/cdi-3.0.html[CDI 3.0], link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/restfulWS-3.0.html[restfulWS 3.0], link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/jsonb-2.0.html[JSON-B 2.0], etc. Functionally, version 2.0 behaves the same as 1.0 because it uses the same version of the underlying implementation (link:https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql[SmallRye GraphQL]).  If you'd like to learn more about MicroProfile GraphQL, see our previous link:{url-prefix}/blog/2020/06/10/microprofile-graphql-open-liberty.html[blog post about MicroProfile GraphQL 1.0] and our link:{url-prefix}/blog/2020/08/28/graphql-apis-open-liberty-20009.html[blog post on how to use the GraphiQL UI and third-party Client APIs].

To enable the MicroProfile GraphQL 2.0 feature, add it to your `server.xml`:
