//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.


As we progress towards full Jakarta EE 10 compliance, the 22.0.0.12-beta release includes six new Jakarta EE 10 specifications, alongside the ones that were included in previous beta releases.  

Jakarta Batch 2.1 provides improved CDI integration while Jakarta XML Web Services 4.0 now incorporates Jakarta Web Services Metadata.  Jakarta Pages 3.1 provides developers an option to raise Exceptions for undefined Expression Language Identifiers, while Jakarta Tags 3.0 includes Tag URI renaming when referencing tag libraries. Jakarta Messaging 3.1 makes connection factory and destination definition annotations repeatable, while Jakarta WebSocket 2.1 allows for the registration of endpoints outside of the deployment phase.



But this beta includes more than just Jakarta EE 10 features; two new MicroProfile 6.0 features are also included! MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 includes simplified JWT validation and MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 provides user-defined metric registry scopes.



The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 22.0.0.12-beta includes the following beta features (along with link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features]):

* Jakarta EE 10:

[#pages]
== Option to raise Exceptions for undefined Expression Language Identifiers (Jakarta Pages 3.1 and Jakarta Tags 3.0)


Jakarta Pages is a template engine that allows developers to mix various content, such as HTML, XML, and Java code, and translate it into a Jakarta Servlet. Jakarta Standard Tag Library allows for tags to encapsulate common functionality used in many web applications. The Open Liberty `pages-3.1` feature is an implementation of both the Jakarta Pages 3.1 and Jakarta Standard Tag Library 3.0 specifications. It includes new features, behavior clarifications, and deprecations from the previous 3.0 version.


The new `pages-3.1` feature allows developers to identify undefined Expression Language variables by using a new option, which raises a `PropertyNotFoundException` and can be set in one of two ways. The `errorOnELNotFound` attribute is set as a page or tag directive.  The  `<error-on-el-not-found>` element is set in  the web.xml file.


Previously, imported packages and classes were only available to the scripting environment (i.e. scriptlet tags). However, with version 3.1, they are also available in the Expression Language environment within the page. Default imports (such as `jakarta.servlet`, `jakarta.servlet.jsp`, `jakarta.servlet.jsp.http`) are consistent between both environments. Related changes included internal refactoring of the `ScopedAttributeELResolver` to create `ImportELResolver` and the addition of the `NotFoundELResolver`, which always resolves the requested value and returns `null`.

Other significant changes include the deprecation of the `isThreadSafe` directive, the `jsp:plugin` (including the related `jsp:params` and `jsp:fallback`) actions, and any methods which overrode `ELResolver.getFeatureDescriptors()`.

As for Jakarta Tags 3.0, the largest change includes the Tag URI renaming when referencing tag libraries. For example, `jakarta.tags.core` now replaces the `http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsp/jstl/core` URI when importing the core tag library.  However, the implementation kept older URIs for backwards compatibility.  The remaining changes related to general clean up of the documentation.
      

To enable the new Jakarta Server Pages 3.1 and Jakarta Standard Tag Library 3.0 features, add the `pages-3.1` feature to your server.xml:
[source,xml]

<featureManager>
   <feature>pages-3.1</feature>

[#websocket]
== Register endpoints outside of the deployment phase (Jakarta WebSocket 2.1)

Jakarta WebSocket allows communication via the WebSocket protocol, allowing for full-duplex communication between endpoints.  This means that a single, persisted connection is made across the endpoints, allowing both the server and client to continuously and simultaneously push information to each other.


Jakarta WebSocket 2.1 is the latest version of the specification and provides several new features and behavior clarifications aimed at improving WebSocket development. Firstly, when setting up dependencies, developers are likely to notice the API JARs are refactored into client and server JARs. However, both APIs are available as part of the `websocket-2.1` feature.


HTTP connection upgrades to the WebSocket protocol can now occur via the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/server/servercontainer#upgradeHttpToWebSocket(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object,jakarta.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,java.util.Map)[`ServerContainer.upgradeHttpToWebSocket()` method​] rather than IBM's specific link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/api/v1/content/SSD28V_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.liberty.doc/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.api.wsoc_1.0-javadoc/com/ibm/websphere/wsoc/WsWsocServerContainer.html#doUpgrade(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse,javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,java.util.Map)[`WsWsocServerContainer.doUpgrade()` method].


Another change regards the `Session#getUserProperties()` method. The returned map is now a copy per endpoint instance, per WebSocket session. Additionally, the server session's user properties are initially populated by the `ServerEndpointConfig.getUserProperties()` method, so endpoints can retrieve properties set in the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/server/serverendpointconfig.configurator#modifyHandshake(jakarta.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,jakarta.websocket.server.HandshakeRequest,jakarta.websocket.HandshakeResponse)[ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator.modifyHandshake() method​]. This is similar to the client session as the user properties are a shallow copy from the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/EndpointConfig.html#getUserProperties()[`EndpointConfig.getUserProperties()`] method.

Lastly, there were many clarifications in the spec, such as requiring the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/session#getRequestURI()[Session.getRequestURI()] method to return the whole URI. These clarifications can be viewed on the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/[Jakarta WebSocket 2.1] page.


 
You can enable the Jakarta WebSocket 2.1 feature by using the `websocket-2.1` feature in the server.xml file,

[source,xml]

<featureManager>

[#batch]
== Improved CDI integration (Jakarta Batch 2.1)
The updates in Jakarta Batch 2.1 primarily focus on improved integration with Context Dependency Injection (CDI). Discovery of Batch artifacts is now standardized via CDI, whereas before it was not fully defined in the specification.

Previously, the default `JobOperator` was only made available from a static factory method, `BatchRuntime.getJobOperator()`. With Jakarta Batch 2.1, the default `JobOperator` is provided as a CDI bean unless one is defined by the user application, if an injectable field is available as defined by: 
[source,java]
----
@Inject 
JobOperator jobOperator;

----

Previously, the `@BatchProperty` annotation allowed for injection of String-type values only, but is now expanded to most other primitive types. For example:

[source,java]
----
@Inject @BatchProperty(name="p1") String p1;

----

This property can have other types in Jakarta Batch 2.1, including `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, and `Double`. For example:
[source,java]
----
@Inject @BatchProperty(name="p1") Integer p1;

----

The `batch-2.1` feature is the implementation of Jakarta Batch 2.1 for use with other Jakarta EE 10 features. It can be activated by including the `batch-2.1` feature directly, or by including `batchManagement-1.0` along with another Jakarta EE 10 feature. For example:
[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
   <feature>batchManagement-1.0</feature>
   <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

[#messaging]
== Connection factory and destination definition annotations are now repeatable (Jakarta Messaging 3.1)
Jakarta Messaging is a set of APIs to standardize message communication between applications, defining how the messages are created, sent, received, and interpreted.  Jakarta Messaging 3.1 provides minor changes and enhancements to the specification.  Two noteworthy updates are the requirement for Java 11 and making the `@JMSConnectionFactoryDefinition` and `@JMSDestinationDefinition` annotations repeatable.

To enable the new Jakarta Messaging 3.1 feature, add the `messaging-3.1` feature to your server.xml:

[source,xml]
---- 
<featureManager>
   <feature>messaging-3.1</feature>
</featureManager>   
----

[#xmlws]
== Jakarta Web Services Metadata incorporated into XML Web Services 4.0

Jakarta XML Web Services 4.0 is a set of APIs that allows applications to deploy SOAP-based web services on the Jakarta EE 10 platform. This set of APIs includes both the XML Web Services 4.0 specification, which now incorporates the Jakarta Web Services Metadata specification, as well as the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments 3.0 specification. 


Although the changes introduced in XML Web Services 4.0 are relatively minor, they do include the requirement for Java SE 11, as well as incorporating the Jakarta Web Services Metadata specification into XML Web Services 4.0. 



To enable the new Jakarta XML Web Services 4.0 feature, add the `xmlWS-4.0` feature to your server.xml:
[source,xml]
---- 
<featureManager>
   <feature>xmlWS-4.0</feature>
</featureManager>   
----

[#jwt]
== Simplified JWT Validation (MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1)
The MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 specification allows the use of a JWT to authenticate and authorize requests to a service. The specification simplifies managing the validation of the JWT by introducing three new MicroProfile Config properties, along with corresponding `mpJwt` attributes.


=== mp.jwt.verify.token.age
The `mp.jwt.verify.token.age` property allows you to specify the number of **seconds** since the JWT token was issued. The `iat` (issued at) claim must be present in the JWT and the configured number of seconds since `iat` must not have elapsed. If it has elapsed, then the request is rejected with an Unauthorized (401) response.


The new `tokenAge` attribute of the `mpJwt` element overrides the `mp.jwt.verify.token.age` property.

=== mp.jwt.verify.clock.skew
The `mp.jwt.verify.clock.skew` property allows you to specify the clock skew in **seconds** used during the token expiry and age verification. The default value is 0 seconds. In order to use this new property, set a negative value for the `clockSkew` attribute of the `mpJwt` element since the `mpJwt` element already has a default value of 5 minutes for the `clockSkew` attribute. For example:
[source,xml]
----
<mpJwt id="myMpJwt" clockSkew="-1"/>
----

If `clockSkew` is not specified or it has a value greater than 0, then it will override the `mp.jwt.verify.clock.skew` property.

=== mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm
The `mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm` property allows you to specify the Key Management Algorithm for decrypting the Content Encryption Key (CEK) when receiving JWE tokens. There is no default value. The `alg` header parameter must be present in the JWE and must be the same value as the `mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm` property. If it is not the same value, then the request is rejected with an Unauthorized (401) response. For example:
[source]
----
mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm=RSA-OAEP
----
The new `keyManagementKeyAlgorithm` attribute of the `mpJwt` element overrides the `mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm` property.  

  
You can enable the MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 feature by using the `mpJwt-2.1` feature in the server.xml file: 
[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
   <feature>mpJwt-2.1</feature>
</featureManager>
----

[#metrics]
== User-defined metric registry scopes (MicroProfile Metrics 5.0)


The MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 feature is the implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 release and is compatible to run only with other Jakarta EE 10 features. This latest version of MicroProfile Metrics includes both new functionality and significant changes to the functionality in MicroProfile Metrics 4.0 (i.e. the Open Liberty `mpMetrics-4.0` feature).  


Before we cover the new, lets first quickly go over the changes to existing functionality.  Most notable is the removal of the `Meter`, `ConcurrentGauge` and `SimpleTimer` metrics. A consequence of this change is that the `REST.request` metric, which was previously backed by a `SimpleTimer` metric, is now a `Timer` metric. For the publishing of metrics, only the Prometheus format is now available, and the JSON formatted output has been removed. Additionally, the metrics endpoint for a specific metric registry scope and metric is no longer accessed through a tree hierarchy, but rather through query params. For example, `/metrics/base/jvm.uptime` is accessed through  `/metrics?scope=base&metric=jvm.uptime`. The `/metrics?scope=base` endpoint by itself retrieves the metrics for the base metric registry.


New in this release is the introduction of user-defined custom scopes. Prior to this release, there was only the base, vendor and application scopes and only the application scope could be used to register metrics. Now, metrics can be registered to a user-defined metric registry scope in one of the following two ways.


==== Scope attribute in a the metric annotations

[source,xml]
----
@Counted(name = "myCounter", scope ="customScope")
public void foo(){
   ...
}
----

==== Inject a metric registry with a custom scope using the new `@RegistryScope` annotation

[source,xml]
----
@Inject 
@RegistryScope(scope="customScope")
MetricRegistry metricRegistry;
----
NOTE: The `@RegistryType` injection qualifier is still available, but is now deprecated.

Furthermore, the `mp.metrics.smallrye.timer.precision` and `mp.metrics.smallrye.histogram.precision` MicroProfile Config properties are introduced in this release. These properties specify the percentile accuracy used by the `Timer` and `Histogram` metrics.  The valid values are 1-5. The default value is `3`. The higher the number, the greater the precision, but the greater the memory usage.


These only the most notable and impactful changes. There are further changes to the API that are not covered in this blog.  For a comprehensive list of changes to the MicroProfile Metrics technology, go to the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics[Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics project page].
