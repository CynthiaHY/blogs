[#SUB_TAG_0]
== Jakarta Batch 2.1


1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): Jakarta Batch 2.1
   
   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): batch-2.1

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations. Application Developer & Operations

3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:

    The batch-2.1 feature is the implementation of Jakarta Batch 2.1 for use with other Jakarta EE 10 features. It can be activated by including the `batch-2.1` feature directly, or including `batchManagement-1.0` along with another EE 10 feature. For example:
    `<featureManager>`
    `   <feature>batchManagement-1.0</feature>`
    `   <feature>servlet-6.0</feature>`
    `</featureManager>`

    The updates in Jakarta Batch 2.1 primarily focus on improved integration with CDI. Discovery of Batch artifacts is now standardized via CDI, whereas before it was not fully defined in the specification.

    Previously, the default JobOperator was only made available from a static factory method, `BatchRuntime.getJobOperator()`. With Jakarta Batch 2.1, the default JobOperator is provided as a CDI bean unless one is defined by the user application, if an injectable field is available as defined by: 
    `@Inject` 
    `JobOperator jobOperator;`

    Finally, the BatchProperty annotation allowed for injection of String-type values only, but has been expanded to most other primitive types. For example:
    `@Inject @BatchProperty(name="p1") String p1;`
    This property can have other types in Jakarta Batch 2.1, including `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, and `Double`. Example:
     `@Inject @BatchProperty(name="p1") Integer p1;`



   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

== BETA BLOG 220012 - MicroProfile JWT 2.1


1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1
   
   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): mpJwt-2.1

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.

    Application developer

3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

> The MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 specification allows using a JWT token for authenticating and authorizing requests to a service. The specification simplifies the configuration for managing the validation of the JWT by introducing 3 new MicroProfile Config properties. New corresponding attributes are also added to the `mpJwt` element.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> Version 2.1 of the MicroProfile JSON Web Token specification adds the following MicroProfile Config properties and `mpJwt` attributes to control different aspects of the JWT validation.

> ### mp.jwt.verify.token.age
> The `mp.jwt.verify.token.age` property allows you to specify the number of **seconds** since the JWT token was issued. The "iat" claim must be present in the JWT and the configured number of seconds since "iat" must not have elapsed. If it has elapsed, then the request is rejected with an Unauthorized (401) response.
>
> The new `tokenAge` attribute of the `mpJwt` element overrides the `mp.jwt.verify.token.age` property.

> ### mp.jwt.verify.clock.skew
> The `mp.jwt.verify.clock.skew` property allows you to specify the clock skew in **seconds** used during the token expiry and age verification. The default value is 0 seconds. In order to use this new property, please set a negative value for the `clockSkew` attribute of the `mpJwt` element since the `mpJwt` element already has a default value of 5 minutes for the `clockSkew` attribute. For example,
>```
>    <mpJwt id="myMpJwt" clockSkew="-1"/>
>```
>
> If `clockSkew` is not specified or it has a value greater than 0, then it will override the `mp.jwt.verify.clock.skew` property.

> ### mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm
> The `mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm` property allows you to specify the Key Management Algorithm for decrypting the Content Encryption Key (CEK) when receiving JWE tokens. There is no default value. The "alg" header parameter must be present in the JWE and must be the same value as the `mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm` property. If it is not the same value, then the request is rejected with an Unauthorized (401) response. For example,
>```
>mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm=RSA-OAEP
>```
>
> The new `keyManagementKeyAlgorithm` attribute of the `mpJwt` element overrides the `mp.jwt.decrypt.key.algorithm` property.
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
> You can enable the MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.1 feature by using the mpJwt-2.1 feature in the server.xml file,

[#SUB_TAG_2]
== MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 for 220012-beta


1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): `MicroProfile Metrics 5.0`
   
   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): `mpMetrics-5.0`

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
     `Application Developer`

3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:

The MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 feature is the implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 release. This feature will only be compatible to run with other Jakarta EE 10 aligned features.  For instance, only `restFulWS-3.1` can be used alongside `mpMetrics-5.0`  Furthermore, there are significant changes in the MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 release which will impact users migrating from MicroProfile Metrics 4.0 (i.e. the OpenLiberty `mpMetrics-4.0` feature).  Most notably is  the removal of the `Meter`, `ConcurrentGauge` and `SimpleTimer` metrics. A consequence of this change is that the `REST.request` metric, which once was backed by a `SimpleTimer` metric is now a `Timer` metric. 

For the publishing of metrics, JSON formatted output is no longer available, only Prometheus format is available. Additionally, the metrics endpoint for specific metric registry scope and metric is no longer accessed through a tree hierarchy, but rather through query params. For example, `/metrics/base/jvm.uptime` will be accessed through  `/metrics?scope=base&metric=jvm.uptime`. The `/metrics?scope=base` endpoint by itself will retrieve the metrics for the base metric registry.

New in this release, however, is the introduction of user-defined custom scopes. Prior to this release, there was only the base, vendor and application scopes and only the application scope could be used to register metrics. Now, metrics can be registered to a user defined metric registry scope in one of two ways:
1. scope attribute in a the metric annotations
```
@Counted(name = "myCounter", scope ="customScope")
public void foo(){
   ...
}
```
2. Inject a metric registry with a custom scope using the new `@RegistryScope` annotation*
```
@Inject 
@RegistryScope(scope="customScope")
MetricRegistry metricRegistry;
```
*It should be noted that the `@RegistryType` injection qualifier is still available, but is now deprecated.

Furthermore, introduced now is the the `mp.metrics.smallrye.timer.precision`  and `mp.metrics.smallrye.histogram.precision` MP Config values. These values specify the percentile accuracy used by the `Timer` and `Histogram` metrics.  The valid values are 1-5. By default, the configuration is 3. The higher the number, the greater the precision, but the greater the memory usage.

The above are only the most notable and impactful changes. There are further changes to the API which have not been covered in this blog.  For a comprehensive list of changes to the MicroProfile Metrics technology, go to the project page at [Eclipse MicroProfile Metris project](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics)

You can enable the MicroProfile Metrics 4.0 feature by using the `mpMetrics-5.0` feature in the server.xml file,

>     <featureManager>              
>         <feature>mpMetrics-5.0</feature>
>     </featureManager>

== XML Web Services 4.0


1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature): XML Web Services 4.0
   
   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): xmlWS-4.0 

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.

Application Developer, Operations

4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   
 Jakarta XML Web Services 4.0 is a set of APIs that allows applications to deploy SOAP Based Web Services on the Jakarta EE 10 platform. This set of APIs includes: XML Web Services 4.0 which now incorporates the Jakarta Web Services Metadata specification, as well as the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments 3.0. 

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

xmlWS-4.0 provides support for Jakarta XML Web Services 4.0 and the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments specifications on Open Liberty. Changes to XML Web Services 4.0, are relatively minor, but it requires Java 11, as well as incorporates Jakarta Web Services Metadata specification into XML Web Services 4.0. 

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

To enable the new Jakarta EE 10 XML Web Services 4.0 feature, add the xmlWS-4.0 feature to your server.xml. Here's an example of what the feature configuration looks like:
```    
   <featureManager>
          <feature>xmlWS-4.0</feature>
    </featureManager>   
```

== Jakarta EE 10: Support Jakarta Pages 3.1 and Jakarta Tags 3.0


1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature):
   > Jakarta Server Pages 3.1
   > Jakarta Standard Tag Library 3.0
   
   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): 
   > pages-3.1

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations."
    > This feature is for Jakarta Enterprise Edition (EE) application developers.
 
3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.  
     > Pages is a template engine that allows developers to mix various content, such as HTML, XML, and java code, and it is translated into a Jakarta Servlet. This pages-3.1 feature is an implementation of the Jakarta EE 10 Pages 3.1 Specification. It includes new features, behavior clarifications, and deprecations from 3.0.
     
     > Jakarta Standard Tag Library allows for tags to encapsulate common functionality used in many web applications. Jakarta Tags is based on the   Jakarta EE 10 Jakarta Standard Tag Library 3.0 Specification. The Pages 3.1 feature bundles the Tags 3.0 API and implementation just as with the previous Pages features.  

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
  
      >This new feature allows developers to identify undefined Expression Language variables via a new option, `errorOnELNotFound` / `<error-on-el-not-found>`, which raises a PropertyNotFoundException. It can be set via a page /tag directive or the web.xml, respectfully.

      >Previously, imported packages and classes were only available to the scripting environment (i.e. scriptlet tags). However, with 3.1, they are also available in the Expression Language environment within the page. Default imports (such as `jakarta.servlet`, `jakarta.servlet.jsp`, `jakarta.servlet.jsp.http`) are consistent between both environments.

      >Related changes included internal refactoring of the ScopedAttributeELResolver to create ImportELResolver and the addition of the NotFoundELResolver, which always resolves the requested value and returns null.

      >Other significant changes include the deprecation of the isThreadSafe directive, the jsp:plugin (including the related   jsp:params and jsp:fallback) actions, and any methods which overrode ELResolver.getFeatureDescriptors().

        > As for Tags 3.0, the largest change includes the Tag URI renaming when referencing tag libraries. For example, `jakarta.tags.core` now replaces the `http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsp/jstl/core` URI when importing the core tag library.   However, the implementation kept older URIs for backwards compatibility.  The remaining changes related to general clean up of the documentation.

1. Which Liberty feature(s) does your update relate to?
    
   Human-readable name (eg WebSockets feature):
   > Jakarta WebSocket 2.1
  
   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): 
   > websocket-2.1

2. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
   > This feature is for Jakarta Enterprise Edition (EE) application developers.
    
3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   > This websocket-2.1 feature, which allows communication for endpoints via the Websocket protocol, is an implementation of the Jakarta EE 10 Websocket 2.1 Specification. It includes new features and behavior clarifications from 2.0. 
   
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

>There have been several enchantments to improve websocket development. Firstly, when setting up dependencies, developers should notice the API jars have been refactored into client and server jars; however, both APIs are available in the websocket-2.1 feature.

>Developers can now register endpoints outside of the deployment phase of the web application (as there was previously a restriction). HTTP connection upgrades to the websocket protocol can now occur via the API's [ServerContainer#upgradeHttpToWebSocket​](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/server/servercontainer#upgradeHttpToWebSocket(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object,jakarta.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,java.util.Map)) rather than IBM's specific [WsWsocServerContainer#doUpgrade](https://www.ibm.com/docs/api/v1/content/SSD28V_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.liberty.doc/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.api.wsoc_1.0-javadoc/com/ibm/websphere/wsoc/WsWsocServerContainer.html#doUpgrade(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse,javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,java.util.Map)) SPI.

>Another change regards jakarta.websocket.Session#getUserProperties(), as the returned map is now a copy per endpoint instance (per websocket session). Additionally, the server session's user properties are initially populated by ServerEndpointConfig.getUserProperties(), thus allowing endpoints to retrieve properties set in [ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator#modifyHandshake​](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/server/serverendpointconfig.configurator#modifyHandshake(jakarta.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,jakarta.websocket.server.HandshakeRequest,jakarta.websocket.HandshakeResponse)). This is similar to the client session as the user properties are a shallow copy from [EndpointConfig.getUserProperties()](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/EndpointConfig.html#getUserProperties()). More can be read in the API doc [here](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/session#getUserProperties()).

>Lastly, there were many clarifications in the spec, such as requiring [Session.getRequestURI()](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/session#getRequestURI()) to return the whole URI, and these clarifications can be viewed on the [Jakarta WebSocket 2.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/) page.
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
