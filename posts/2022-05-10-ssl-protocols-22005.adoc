[#ssl]
=== Liberty support for configuring multiple SSL protocols

With this feature users will be able to configure multiple `SSL`/`TLS` protocol values on the `sslProtocol` attribute of the `SSL`/`TLS` configuration. Values in the list can include combinations of protocols values: `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, and `TLSv1.3`. This allows users to create a small custom set of protocols the server can use for `SSL`/`TLS` Connections. There are protocol values that represent multiple protocols like `TLS`, can not be part of a list.

Until now users could only configure a single value in on the `sslProtocol` attribute of the, the single values will either represent a single protocol or all larger list of protocols. With this user can build a smaller custom list of protocols the server will accept. Likely the most common set list of protocols to use is the use of the 2 strongest protocols, `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`.

To configure a comma separate list of protocol values can be set on the `sslProtocol` attribute in the `SSL` configuration.

[source, xml]
----
<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStore="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2"
----

With this configuration of inbound connections will only accept connection from client using either `TLSv1.3`. or `TLSv1.2`. Outbound connections will be limited to the 2 protocols as well.

Add the feature to the `server.xml`:

<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>transportSecurity-1.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
</server>

[#schemaGen]
== New schemaGen wrapper for ws-schemagen.jar

The existing `ws-schemagen.jar` tool, in the `wlp/bin/tools` directory, is used to generate the schema for Liberty core and other installed products.

Prior to 22.0.0.5, the way to run the tool was using the following syntax. This syntax still works, but now there is an easier way:

[source]
----
java [JVM options] -jar ws-schemagen.jar [options] outputFile
----

In version, 22.0.0.5, a `schemaGen` script is added to the `wlp/bin/tools` directory. This is simply a wrapper script that executes the `JAR` which makes the syntax a little easier. The following is the new syntax. Use the `--help` option for a list of options.

[source]
----
./schemaGen [options] outputFile
----
