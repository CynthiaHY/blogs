[#ssl]
=== Liberty support for configuring multiple SSL protocols

This feature introduces the ability to configure multiple, specific `SSL`/`TLS` protocol values on the `sslProtocol` attribute of the `SSL`/`TLS` configuration.  

Prior to this release, only a single value could be specified for the `sslProtocol` attribute which either set a single protocol, like in the case of `TLSv1`, or multiple protocols that are user unalterable, like in the case of `TLS` which enables TLS v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2 protocols in IBMJSSE2.  Starting with this release, a user can specify a list of specific protocols that they'd like to enable, allowing them to create small, custom set of protocols the server can use for `SSL`/`TLS` connections.  One likely usecase for this is to set the value to the two cryptographically strongest protocols: `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`.  Note that values that would enable multiple protocols, such as `TLS` cannot be included in the list.  

To configure a comma separate list of protocol values can be set on the `sslProtocol` attribute in the `SSL` configuration.

[source, xml]
----
<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStore="defaultKeyStore" sslProtocol="TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2" />
----

With this configuration of inbound connections will only accept connection from client using either `TLSv1.3` or `TLSv1.2`. Outbound connections will be limited to the 2 protocols as well.

Add the feature to the `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>transportSecurity-1.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
</server>

[#schemaGen]
== New schemaGen wrapper for ws-schemagen.jar

The existing `ws-schemagen.jar` tool, in the `wlp/bin/tools` directory, is used to generate the schema for a Liberty installation and other installed product extensions.

Prior to 22.0.0.5, the way to run the tool was using the following syntax:

[source]
----
java [JVM options] -jar ws-schemagen.jar [options] outputFile
----

In this release a `schemaGen` script is added to the `wlp/bin/tools` directory. This is simply a wrapper script that executes the `JAR` making the syntax a little easier:

[source]
----
./schemaGen [options] outputFile
----

== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A22005+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.5].

We've now resolved this issue and users should no longer experience an exception.

+
Previously, closing a secure WebSocket connection that has timed out could cause a WebContainer thread to hang as follows:
+
[source, role="no_copy"]
----

We've now fixed this issue meaning that the WebSocket should close the connection and the WebContainer thread should exit as expected.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/20509[JSP included jar dependency check incorrect]
+
When a `JSP` included another `JSP` that's contained in a `jar` under `WEB-INF/lib`, the out of date dependency checking exhibited two problems depending on the value of `jsp-attribute` `trackDependencies`. When `trackDependencies` is `true` (default) the date check can fail causing the `JSP` to recompile at each call. This has the symptom of repeating messages
+
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
SRVE0242I: [ ... ] Initialization successful.
SRVE0253I: [ ... ] Destroy successful.
----
+
When `trackDependencies` is `false`, there could be a `NullPointerException` as follows:
+
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.AbstractJSPExtensionServletWrapper.isDependentOutdated(AbstractJSPExtensionServletWrapper.java:735)

at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.AbstractJSPExtensionServletWrapper.handleRequest(AbstractJSPExtensionServletWrapper.java:163)
....
----
+
Now, `JSP`s should not recompile on each call unless there is a valid update of an included file, and users should no longer experience `NullPointerExceptions`. This issue was caused by a failure to initialize a `dependentsList` when `trackDependencies` is `false`.

+
Netty components in Open Liberty were of the version `4.1.72.Final` which was released in December 2021. The latest version `4.1.75.Final` contains various bug fixes and improvements over the current version. We've pulled in the newest Netty release (`4.1.75`) to ensure Open Liberty stays up to date with upstream fixes and improvements.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/20782[FeatureUtility isf does not resolve already installed user feature]
+
Since Open Liberty 22.0.0.3, `featureUtility` `installServerFeature` command failed to locate the user feature when the feature was installed to `WLP_USER_DIR`. We should expect the features to be installed or the user should be informed that the feature is already installed. We found that `WLP_USER_DIR` was being overwritten which caused issues when trying to find features which were already installed to `WLP_USER_DIR`. This issue has now been resolved.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/20476[NPE when outputting SimpleTimer close to the end of a full minute]
+
When the `/metrics` endpoint is hit and a `SimpleTimer` metric is being formatted there are two explicit calls made to retrieve the value of the `SimpleTimer` (of the min time duration or max time duration). Previously, it could be that these two calls were made before and after the completion of a full minute. This could have lead to a `NullPointerException` if the `SimpleTimer` removed the value as part of the completion of the full minute (i.e. in that the previous full minute did not record any values to update the min/max values).
+

	at com.ibm.ws.microprofile.metrics.BaseMetricsHandler.handleRequest(BaseMetricsHandler.java:83)
----
+
We've patched this issue by ensuring that `PrometheusBuilder` does not make separate retrival of `SimpleTimer` max/min values but rather uses a saved value when formatting. This means that users no longer experience this `NullPointerException`.
