= Open Liberty and Antora: an open source solution to generate our docs

== What is Antora?

define antora, preview why we moved

== Benefits for users

previous system- challenges

meaningful navigation
 based on guides
  reflect familiar structure
  promote cross pollination

versioning
  important for a 4weeek release cycle-
  how versioning cinnects users with rlevant information
  zero migration and feature versions

multiple repositories from a single playbook
  keeps the docs closer to code and helps us optimize the various components in a loosely coupled way.

== community solution

Reusing and supporting existing project (and asciidoc project) rather than writing our own. Asciidoc does so much out-of-the-box (I've seen multiple other projects using markdown and having to code their own extensions to it to do the same things that Asciidoc just does anyway).
Can ask questions of community, and potentially answer them too.
If we code our own extension to something not yet available, we can offer it back to the project (eg translation support) - we're not quite there yet so will depend on where they're up to by the time we get to it on our side.
eg "Thanks to Antora's vibrant and helpful community, we've received help along our journey and look forward to contributing back to the community, whether with code or answering other users' questions."
