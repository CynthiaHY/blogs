Open Liberty recently moved to the open source Antora framework to generate and manage our docs. This post looks at the motivating factors behind this move: navigation, versioning, and community support.

== What is Antora?

https://antora.org/[Antora] is a multi-repository documentation site generator for technical documents that are written in AsciiDoc. Antora specifically targets technical documentation and offers unique solutions for some of the most prevalent challenges of writing, hosting, and maintaining meaningful docs. https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc] is a lightweight markup language, similar to Markdown, but more flexible and better suited to the structural requirements of technical documentation.

Both Antora and Asciidoc are designed on the premiss that writers want to spend their time writing, not fussing around with complex formatting or elaborate content management systems (CMS). The underlying simplicity of both these tools appealed to our team. However, Antora also addressed some specific challenges that we faced as our docs evolved along with the rest of the Open Liberty project.

== New docs, new framework

Before our move to Antora, our documentation was already written in Asciidoc but our doc site generator was a custom implementation based around Jekyll. We started with a relatively small doc set that consisted of a handful concept topics and a streamlined reference section for features and configuration elements. The docs navigation was a simple alphabetical list that was autogenerated by the site build. At that time, the Open Liberty project was on a roughly 16-week release cycle.

To better support a continuous integration workflow and provide faster update cycles for our users, Open Liberty soon accelerated to a four-week release cycle. As the pace of development increased, so did the volume of the documentation. Within the space of a year, the number of topics almost tripled and we enhanced our reference documentation with a collection of concise grab-and-go configuration examples. Before we knew it, our documentation family had outgrown its quaint apartment and was ready to move into a modern home.

== Reaping the benefits

This faster release cycle resulted in more versions of the documentation to host and maintain. And the larger collection of docs meant that our users needed better navigation. We also had to address some requirements that were specific to the structure and design of Open Liberty. We needed the flexibility to inject our own customizations into whatever framework we used. On each of these accounts, Antora presents novel solutions.

=== Meaningful navigation
Antora treats https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/features/#navigation-as-content[navigation as content]. Site navigation is defined in a simple Asciidoc list that requires no special formatting. This approach makes it easy to update and maintain the navigation and to experiment with different navigation strategies. With Antora, breaking the navigation into meaningful sections and providing helpful cross-references to other areas of the Open Liberty site was simple to configure. We were able to test different ideas and change them quickly when we found a better option. We modeled our updated navigation categories on the existing categories in our link:guides/[guides], with which many of our users are already familiar. As our docs continue to grow and evolve, creating new categories or editing existing ones is as simple as adding and removing items from a list.

=== Versatile versioning
With a 4-week release cycle, new functions are constantly being developed, and with them, new documentation. The Open Liberty commitment to link:/docs/latest/zero-migration-architecture.html[zero migration] means our users must be able to move easily across runtime versions, mixing and matching features according to the needs of their applications. The documentation must support this flexibility by making it easy to find the relevant docs for any version.

Antora treats https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/component-versions/#branches-as-versions[each version of the docs as a distinct branch] in the Git structure. Each new branch is created from the existing reference of the previous version so that only the updated content changes when a new branch is added. This approach makes it easy for our team to compare and manage the different versions of a doc. And for our users, moving between doc versions is as simple as selecting the relevant version from the version picker at the beginning of our sidebar navigation.

=== A vibrant community
Thanks to the vibrant and helpful Antora community, we've received plenty of help along our journey and look forward to contributing back, whether with code or by answering other users' questions. The beauty of an open source project like Antora (and Open Liberty) is that nothing happens in a bubble and all participants can benefit from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect#Technology_lifecycle[the network effect]. New capabilities and bug fixes are added with https://gitlab.com/antora/antora[each Antora release]. We are happy to pass these benefits along to our users and share our own experience with the Antoracommunity.

== Docs as code
The Antora multi-repository framework supports a https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[Docs as Code] approach to documentation, wherein documentation is written with the same tools as code and managed from the same repositories. This framework means you can build your docs from multiple sources that are maintained in the same repositories as the code, rather than siloed in a CMS. For Open Liberty, it enables us to manage different sections of our documentation, such as concept topics, Javadoc, and feature  reference material, in a loosely coupled way. We can make changes and improvements to different aspects of the docs without having to overhaul the entire collection. It also enables us to build some of this content directly out of the source code files into its own repo, which makes troubleshooting and maintenance more straightforward.
