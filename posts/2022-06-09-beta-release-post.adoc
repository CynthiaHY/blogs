Open Liberty 22.0.0.7-beta offers Time Based Log Rollover, which enables you to specify a time of day for log files  to roll over. This release also includes the addition of the application name to the LogRecordContext Extension and a corresponding JSON logging field.

The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 22.0.0.7-beta includes the following beta features (along with all GA features):

* <<log_rollover, Time Based Log Rollover for Liberty>>
* <<logrecordcontext, Add application name to LogRecordContext Extension and as JSON logging field>>

[#log_rollover]
== Time Based Log Rollover for Liberty

Liberty provides a few different log files; a `message.log` is created by default, and a `trace.log` and `http_access.log` can be enabled for tracing and `NCSA` access logs respectively. Previously, these log files could be rolled over only by either server restart or by limiting the maximum log file size with the `maxFileSize` logging attribute. Instead of file size-based log rollover, users may want to roll over their files at periodic times to facilitate their existing log cleaning or archival processes. 

Now, you can enable time-based periodic rollover of those log files at their own specified time of day by using two new optional logging configuration attributes: `rolloverInterval` and `rolloverStartTime`. These rolled log files are complete, and their file names are appended with a timestamp that corresponds to the time that the log was rolled over.

* `rolloverInterval` is the desired time interval between log rollovers. Set the attribute with a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be days (d), hours (h), or minutes (m). For example, specify 5 hours as 5h. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1d5h is equivalent to 1 day and 5 hours.

* `rolloverStartTime` is the time of day when logs first roll over and the first rollover interval duration begins. Valid values for this attribute follow a 24-hour ISO-8601 date and time format of HH:MM, where 00:00 represents midnight. 

The two configuration attributes are optional. If neither of the attributes are set, then time based log rollover is not enabled. If only one of the two attributes is set, then time based log rollover is enabled, and the other attribute is set to its default. The default value for `rolloverInterval` is `1d`, and the default value for `rolloverStartTime` is `00:00`.

Example `server.xml` file configuration for  log rollover in the  `messages.log` and `trace.log` files by specifying the new attributes in the `logging` element:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
   ...
    <logging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d"/>
    ...
</server>
----

Example `server.xml` file configuration for log rollover in the `http_access.log` file by specifying the new attributes in  the `httpAccessLogging` element:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
   ...
    <httpAccessLogging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d" logFormat='%h %u %{t}W "%r" %s %b' />
    ...
</server>
----

Example `server.xml` configuration for access logging, using `<accessLogging/>` under `<httpEndpoint/>`, which handles `http_access.log` rollover:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
   ...
   <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint">
      <accessLogging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d" logFormat='%h %i %u %t "%r" %s %b' />
   </httpEndpoint>
    ...
</server>
----

Example logs, rolled over every minute, with a configuration of `rolloverInterval="1m"` and `rolloverStartTime="00:00"`:

[#logrecordcontext]
== Add application name to LogRecordContext Extension and as JSON logging field

Previously, Liberty logs did not contain the application name in its `LogRecordContext` extension. If  you were using a log analysis tool, such as the ELK stack, you couldn't  filter out application logs, since the `JSON` fields did not have a field for the application name. 

In Open Liberty 22.0.0.7-beta, when application log messages are logged and the application name is known, the application name is added to the LogRecordContext, with the key `appName` and the value being the application name that the message was logged from. When JSON Logging is enabled, a new default JSON field (`ext_appName`) is added to the JSON application logs, which contain the application name that log message was logged from.

You can use this feature can by enabling JSON Logging support for your Liberty logs. For more information on how to enable JSON logging in Liberty, please refer to the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/log-trace-configuration.html#json[following documentation].
