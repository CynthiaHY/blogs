//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title.
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-02-generate-microprofile-rest-client-code.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

Developers need tools  for cloud-native application development that are both intuitive and delightful. Enter Liberty Tools: a set developer tools for the Eclipse IDE, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ IDEA development environments.

Liberty Tools can simplify your iterative coding cycle by taking away mundane manual tasks and providing coding support for the APIs you use. They also give you flexibility in your choice of development environment.

Liberty Tools bring together a range of capabilities:

* Iterate fast with Liberty dev mode integrated within your IDE. With dev mode, we do the heavy lifting for you: code changes are automatically detected, recompiled, and deployed whenever you save a new change.
* Write code confidently using Jakarta EE and Jakarta EE APIs with assistance such as validations, quick fixes, completions.
* Edit Liberty configuration files easily with assistance.
* Build applications to run on Liberty with Maven and Gradle using Liberty Maven and Gradle plugins

Today, we are delighted to share that an early release refresh of the Liberty Tools. This release provides a core set of capabilities for building cloud-native applications with Liberty, including support for Jakarta EE 9.x Web Profile and MicroProfile 3 & 4 APIs.  Try them out:
