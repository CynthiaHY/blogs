= Deploy Java applications to IBM Cloud Code Engine using the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty

link:https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine[IBM Cloud Code Engine] provides the next level of easy application deployment and mature management of critical business applications in IBM Cloud. Use Code Engine to easily deploy Java applications using the link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2022/04/01/cloud-native-liberty-buildpack.html[Paketo Buildpack for Liberty] with your container images or source code. With the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty you can use Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty to run your application.  

The intent of this blog is not a Code Engine tutorial but to provide instructions on how to use the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty with Code Engine. 

== What do you need?
* An https://www.ibm.com/cloud[IBM Cloud] Account
* Your application source

To deploy container images you'll also need:

* The link:https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[pack CLI]
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* An externally accessible container registry that can host your images. 

Details on deploying your application from repository source code from the Code Engine console can be found link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code#deploy-app-source-code[here].

Details on deploying your application from repository source code with the CLI can be found link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-source-code#deploy-app-source-code-cli[here].

== Code Engine build strategies
Code Engine can build your container from source with link:paketo.io[Paketo buildpacks] using the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build#build-buildpack-strat[Cloud Native Buildpacks] build strategy. The Paketo Buildpack for Liberty is included in the composite Paketo Buildpack for Java that also includes `tomcat` and `tomee` application servers. Tomcat is the default application server and to use Open Liberty requires a little extra configuration. The application server that the Paketo Buildpack for Java will use is influenced by the environment variable `BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER`.  If undefined, the order of Java application servers in the buildpack dictates which one will be picked. Normally, environment variables are provided to buildpacks using the `--env` parameter on the `pack build` CLI command. Code Engine does not use `pack` so the environment variables have to be provided in a `.buildenv` file in the application's root source directory.  

== Let's get started

Create the `.buildenv` file in the application's root source directory. At a minimum, `.buildenv` should contain `BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty` but can contain other environment variables consumed by buildpacks.
```
BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty
```

Login to the IBM Cloud console and head to the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview[Code Engine overview] page.  When building from source, enter the url of the respository hosting your source and press `Start creating  ->`.

image:/img/blog/code_engine_overview.png[IBM Cloud Code Engine Overview,align="center"]

On the `Start creating` page it's important to enter `9080` for `Listening port`.
[.img_border_light]

We recommend setting the minimum number of instances to `1` in the `Runtime settings` section.
[.img_border_light]
image:img/blog/code_engine_min_instances.png[Minimum instances,width=70%,align="center"] 

Press `Specify build details`. 
In this example, the source root is the `finish` directory and contains the `.buildenv` file.

image:/img/blog/code_engine_git_repo.png[Root of the application's source directory,width=70%,align="center]

Press `Next` and select the `Cloud native buildpack` strategy.  Press `Next`.
[.img_border_light]
image:/img/blog/code_engine_build_strategy.png[Build strategy,align="center"]

Enter the details of where Code Engine will store your image and press `Done`.

Press `Create` to have Code Engine create and deploy your application.  

The `Build step details` output will show the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty contributed to the image.

Similarly, if you're creating your application from source using the Code Engine CLI you need to specify the `port` and build strategy along with the `.buildenv` file present in the application source root directory:

  $ ibmcloud ce app create --name MYAPPNAME --image REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY --registry-secret SECRET --build-source . --strategy buildpacks --port 9080

```
[finish (prod=)]$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x   7 kevin  staff   224 Oct 28 14:54 .
drwxr-xr-x  12 kevin  staff   384 Oct 19 11:07 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff    26 Nov  4 12:53 .buildenv
-rw-r--r--   1 kevin  staff   790 Oct 19 11:07 Dockerfile
-rw-r--r--@  1 kevin  staff  4066 Oct 19 11:07 pom.xml
drwxr-xr-x   4 kevin  staff   128 Oct 19 11:07 src
drwxr-xr-x  11 kevin  staff   352 Oct 20 08:53 target
```

.To summarize, two important configuration steps are required to use the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty in Code Engine:
. Create a `.buildenv` file with `BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty`
. Set the listening port to 9080

= Other configurations using the `.buildenv` file
`BP_LIBERTY_INSTALL_TYPE` link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#install-types[Install type] of Liberty, Open Liberty (ol) or WebSphere Liberty (wlp).  Open Liberty is the default.

`BP_LIBERTY_PROFILE` to specify which liberty profile to install. Valid profiles for Open and WebSphere Liberty are documented link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#profiles[here].

`BP_LIBERTY_FEATURES` a space separated list of Liberty features to be installed with the Liberty runtime. Supports any valid Liberty feature.

== Taking full advantage of all what the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty has to offer
Code Engine doesn't use the `pack build` CLI to create container images. It plugs into the cloud native buildpack's lifecycle natively. As a result, some features of the Paketo Buildpack for Liberty are not easily available to Code Engine. Features like link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty/blob/main/docs/installing-ifixes.md[installing iFixes] and link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#using-custom-features[custom features], and installing from a link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#building-from-a-packaged-server[packaged server] or link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty#building-from-a-liberty-server[server directory] can't be utilized using Code Engine to create the container image. For these features, you can use the `pack build` CLI to create the container image, push the image to an external container registry and use Code Engine to deploy and manage your container by pulling your container image from the container registry from the Code Engine console or CLI.
