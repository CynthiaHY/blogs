== Support LTPA keys rotation without requiring planned outage

== Support LTPA keys rotation without a planned outage

Open Liberty can now automatically generate new primary LTPA keys files while continuing to use validation keys files to validate LTPA tokens. This update enables you to rotate LTPA keys without any disruption to the application's user experience.  Previously, application users had to log in to their applications again after the Liberty server LTPA keys were rotated, which is no longer necessary.


Primary Keys are LTPA keys in the specified keys default `ltpa.keys` file. Primary keys are used both for generating new LTPA tokens and for validating LTPA tokens. There can only be one primary keys file per Liberty runtime.


Validation keys are LTPA keys in any `.keys` files other than the primary keys file. The validation keys are used only for validating LTPA tokens. They are _not_ used for generating new LTPA tokens. All validation keys must be located in the same directory as the primary keys file.


  
There are 2 ways to enable LTPA keys rotation without a planned outage: monitoring the primary keys file directory or specifying the validation keys file.


=== Monitor the directory of the primary keys file for any new validation keys files. 

Enable the `monitorDirectory` and `monitorInterval` attributes. For example, add the following configurations to the `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<ltpa monitorDirectory="true" monitorInterval="5m"/>

----

The `monitorDirectory` attribute monitors the `${server.config.dir}/resources/security/` directory by default, but can monitor any directory the primary keys file is specified in. The directory monitor looks for any LTPA keys files with the `.keys` extension. The Open Liberty server reads these LTPA keys and uses them as validation keys.


If the `monitorInterval` is set to `0`, the default value, the directory is not monitored.


The `ltpa.keys` file can be renamed, for example, `validation1.keys` and then Liberty automatically regenerates a new `ltpa.keys` file with new primary keys that are used for all new LTPA tokens created. The keys in `validation1.keys` continue to be used for validating existing LTPA tokens. 


When the `validation1.keys` are no longer needed, remove them by deleting the file or by setting `monitorDirectory` to `false`. It is recommended to remove unused validation keys as it can improve performance.


=== Specify the validation keys file and optionally specify a date-time to stop using the validation keys.

   1. Copy the primary keys file (`ltpa.keys`) to a validation keys file, for example `validation1.keys`.
   2. Modify the server configuration to use the validation keys file  by specifying a `validationKeys` server configuration element inside the `ltpa` element. For example, add the following configuration to the `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<ltpa>
    <validationKeys fileName="validation1.keys" password="{xor}Lz4sLCgwLTs=" notUseAfterDate="2024-01-02T12:30:00Z"/>
<ltpa/>  
----

The `validation1.keys` file can be removed from use at a specified date-time in the future with the optional `notUseAfterDate` attribute. It is recommended to use `notUseAfterDate` to ignore validation keys after a given period as it can improve performance.


The `fileName` and `password` attributes are required in the `validationKeys` element, but `notUseAfterDate` is optional.

After the validation keys file is loaded from the server configuration update, the original primary keys file (`ltpa.keys`) can be deleted, which triggers new primary keys to be created while continuing to use `validation1.keys` for validation.

Specifying validation keys in this way can be combined with enabling monitor directory to also use validation keys that are not specified in the `server.xml` configuration at the same time. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<ltpa monitorDirectory="true" monitorInterval="5m">
    <validationKeys fileName="validation1.keys" password="{xor}Lz4sLCgwLTs=" notUseAfterDate="2024-01-02T12:30:00Z"/>
<ltpa/>
----

There are 2 ways to enable LTPA keys rotation without a planned outage: monitoring the primary keys file directory or specifying the validation keys file.
### Monitor the directory of the primary keys file for any new validation keys files.

Enable the `monitorValidationKeysDir` and `monitorInterval` attributes. For example, add the following configurations to the server.xml:
```
<ltpa monitorValidationKeysDir="true" monitorInterval="5s"/>
```
The `monitorValidationKeysDir` attribute monitors the directory of the primary keys file for any `.keys` extension files. By default, this directory is `${server.config.dir}/resources/security/` but can be configured. The Open Liberty server loads these LTPA keys and uses them as validation keys. 

Note that monitoring is only enabled when the `updateTrigger` is set to `polled` and the `monitorInterval` is set to a duration greater than 0. The default value of `updateTrigger` is `polled` and the default value of `monitorInterval` is `0`.

The `ltpa.keys` file can be renamed, for example, `validation1.keys` and then Liberty automatically regenerates a new `ltpa.keys` file with new primary keys that are used for all new LTPA tokens created. The keys in `validation1.keys` continue to be used for validating existing LTPA tokens.

When the `validation1.keys` are no longer needed, remove them by deleting the file or by setting `monitorValidationKeysDir` to false. It is recommended to remove unused validation keys as it can improve performance.

### Specify the validation keys file and optionally specify a date-time to stop using the validation keys.

1. Copy the primary keys file (`ltpa.keys`) to a validation keys file, for example `validation1.keys`.

2. Modify the server configuration to use the validation keys file by specifying a `validationKeys` server configuration element inside the `ltpa` element. For example, add the following configuration to the `server.xml` file:
```
<ltpa>
    <validationKeys fileName="validation1.keys" password="{xor}Lz4sLCgwLTs=" validUntilDate="2024-01-02T12:30:00Z"/>
</ltpa>
```
The `validation1.keys` file can be removed from use at a specified date-time in the future with the optional `validUntilDate` attribute. It is recommended to use `validUntilDate` to ignore validation keys after a given period as it can improve performance.

The `fileName` and `password` attributes are required in the `validationKeys` element, but `validUntilDate` is optional.

After the validation keys file is loaded from the server configuration update, the original primary keys file (`ltpa.keys`) can be deleted, which triggers new primary keys to be created while continuing to use `validation1.keys` for validation.

Specifying validation keys in this way can be combined with enabling monitor directory to also use validation keys that are not specified in the `server.xml` configuration at the same time. For example:
```
<ltpa monitorValidationKeysDir="true" monitorInterval="5s">
    <validationKeys fileName="validation1.keys" password="{xor}Lz4sLCgwLTs=" validUntilDate="2024-01-02T12:30:00Z"/>
</ltpa>
```

### UpdateTrigger attribute added to LTPA element
LTPA keys files can be reloaded by the server if the `updateTrigger` attribute is set to `polled` or `mbean`. It is `polled` by default. If set to `polled`, then the server monitors the keys files for changes based on the rate set in the `monitorInterval` attribute. If the `updateTrigger` attribute is set to `mbean` then the server will reload the keys files when it receives notification from the `WebSphere:service=com.ibm.ws.kernel.filemonitor.FileNotificationMBean` MBean. For example:
```
<ltpa monitorValidationKeysDir="true" updateTrigger="mbean"/>
```
If `updateTrigger` is set to `disabled` then no file monitoring will occur.

== MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1: OpenAPI doc endpoint path configuration


MicroProfile OpenAPI generates and serves OpenAPI documentation for JAX-RS applications that are deployed to the Open Liberty server. The OpenAPI documentation is served from `/openapi` and a user interface for browsing this documentation is served from `/openapi/ui`.

With MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1, you can configure the paths for these endpoints by adding configuration to your `server.xml`. For example:
     
[source,xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI docPath="/my/openapi/doc/path" uiPath="/docsUi" />
----

When you set this configuration on a local test server, you can then access the OpenAPI document at `localhost:9080/my/openapi/doc/path` and the UI at `localhost:9080/docsUi`.


This is particularly useful if you want to expose the OpenAPI documentation through a Kubernetes ingress which routes requests to different services based on the path. For example, with this ingress configuration:

[source,yaml]
----

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: my-ingress
spec:
rules:
- http:
    paths:
    - path: /appA
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
        service:
            name: appA
            port:
            number: 9080
----

You could use the following `server.xml` configuration to ensure that the OpenAPI UI is available at `/appA/openapi/ui`:

[source,xml]
----
<mpOpenAPI docPath="/appA/openapi" />
----

When `uiPath` is not set,  it defaults to the value of `docPath` with `/ui` appended.

=== MicroProfile Metrics 5.1: configure statistics tracked by Histogram and Timer metrics 


   
MicroProfile Metrics 5.1 includes new MicroProfile Config properties that are used for configuring the statistics that the Histogram and Timer metrics track and output. In MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, the Histogram and Timer metrics only track and output the _max_ recorded value, the _sum_ of all values, the _count_ of the recorded values, and a static set of percentiles for the 50th, 75th, 95th, 98th, 99th, and 99.9th percentile. These values are emitted to the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format.



The new properties introduced in MicroProfile Metrics 5.1 allow you to define a custom set of percentiles as well as a custom set of histogram buckets for the Histogram and Timer metrics. There are also additional configuration properties for enabling a default set of histogram buckets, including properties for defining an upper and lower bound for the bucket set.

The properties in the following table allow you to define a semicolon-separated list of value definitions using the syntax:


[source]
----
metric_name=value_1[,value_2…value_n]
----




[%header,cols="1,1"]
|===
| Property  |Description
| mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles
a| - Defines a custom set of percentiles for matching Histogram and Timer metrics to track and output. 
- Accepts a set of integer and decimal values for a metric name pairing. 
- Can be used to disable percentile output if no value is provided with a metric name pairing.


| mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.buckets
a| - Defines a custom set of (cumulative) histogram buckets for matching Histogram metrics to track and output.  
- Accepts a set of integer and decimal values for a metric name pairing.


| mp.metrics.distribution.timer.buckets
a| - Defines a custom set of (cumulative) histogram buckets for matching Timer metrics to track and output.
 - Accepts a set of decimal values with a time unit appended (i.e., ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing.


|mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram.enabled
a| - Configures any matching Histogram or Timer metric to provide a large set of default histogram buckets to allow for percentile configuration with a monitoring tool. 
- Accepts a true/false value for a metric name pairing.


| mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.max-value
a| - When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Timer, this property defines a upper bound for the buckets reported. 
- Accepts a single integer or decimal value for a metric name pairing.


| mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.min-value
a| - When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Timer, this property defines a lower bound for the buckets reported. 
- Accepts a single integer or decimal value for a metric name pairing.


|mp.metrics.distribution.timer.max-value
a| - When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Histogram, this property defines a upper bound for the buckets reported. 
- Accepts a single decimal values with a time unit appended (i.e., ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing.

|mp.metrics.distribution.timer.min-value
a| - When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Histogram, this property defines a lower bound for the buckets reported. 
- Accepts a single decimal value with a time unit appended (i.e., ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing.

|===

Some properties can accept multiple values for a given metric name while some can only accept a single value.
You can use an asterisk (i.e., *) as a wild card at the end of the metric name.
For example, the `mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles` can be defined as:

[source]
----
mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles=alpha.timer=0.5,0.7,0.75,0.8;alpha.histogram=0.8,0.85,0.9,0.99;delta.*=
----

This example creates the `alpha.timer` timer metric to track and output the 50th, 70th, 75th, and 80th percentile values. The `alpha.histogram` histogram metric outputs the 80th, 85th, 90th, and 99th percentiles values. Percentiles are disabled for any Histogram or Timer metric that matches with `delta.*` .


We'll expand on the previous example and define histogram buckets for the `alpha.timer` timer metric using the `mp.metrics.distribution.timer.buckets` property:


[source,xml]
----
mp.metrics.distribution.timer.buckets=alpha.timer=100ms,200ms,1s
----

This configuration tells the metrics runtime to track and output the count of durations that fall within 0-100ms, 0-200ms, and 0-1 seconds. These values are ranges because the histogram buckets work _cumulatively_ .


The corresponding Prometheus output for the `alpha.timer` metric at the `/metrics` REST endpoint is:

[source]
----
# HELP alpha_timer_seconds_max  
# TYPE alpha_timer_seconds_max gauge
alpha_timer_seconds_max{scope="application",} 5.633
# HELP alpha_timer_seconds  
# TYPE alpha_timer_seconds histogram <1>
alpha_timer_seconds{scope="application",quantile="0.5",} 0.67108864
alpha_timer_seconds{scope="application",quantile="0.7",} 5.603590144
alpha_timer_seconds{scope="application",quantile="0.75",} 5.603590144
alpha_timer_seconds{scope="application",quantile="0.8",} 5.603590144
alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{scope="application",le="0.1",} 0.0 <2>
alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{scope="application",le="0.2",} 0.0 <2>
alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{scope="application",le="1.0",} 1.0 <2>
alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{scope="application",le="+Inf",} 2.0  <2><3>
alpha_timer_seconds_count{scope="application",} 2.0
alpha_timer_seconds_sum{scope="application",} 6.333
----

<1> The Prometheus metric type is `histogram`. Both the quantiles or percentiles and buckets are represented under this type. 
<2> The `le` tag represents _less than_ and is for the defined buckets, which are converted to seconds.
<3> Prometheus requires a `+Inf` bucket, which counts all hits.

4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

Authorization requests can be done using wither the Implicit Flow or the Authorization Code flow. When using the Implicit Flow, all tokens are returned from the Authorization Endpoint; the Token Endpoint is not used. When using the Authorization Code Flow, all tokens are returned from the Token Endpoint.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
  
      Before, Liberty would only send the resource parameter during an Implicit Flow request. So if one would require the resource parameter and could only use the Authorization Code Flow, this action would fail. This update sends the resource parameter additionally for the Authorization Code Flow.
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
To make this update work, a check was removed that only sent the resource parameter during an Implicit Flow. If now sends it for both flows.

4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   For authentication and authorization, a token is a digital object that contains information about the identity of the principal making the request and what kind of access they are authorized for. There are two types of tokens usually; access tokens and ID tokens.

    

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
ID tokens are JSON Web Tokens that conform to the OpenID Connect specification. Currently, user role information can only be obtained from this ID token. If role information was not provided within the ID token, then the information would not be found. This feature provides checks to attempt to obtain role information from Access Token if it is not found within the ID token.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

A check was added to attempt to get the role information from access token, if it was not found within the ID token.

4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
MicroProfile Telemetry 1.1 provides developers with the latest Open Telemetry technology as the feature now consumes OpenTelemetry-1.29.0 which has been updated from 1.19.0. Consequently, a lot of the dependencies are now stable. 

The feature is compatible with Java EE 7 with MicroProfile 1.4, Java EE 8 with MicroProfile 4.1, Jakarta EE 9 with MicroProfile 5.0 and Jakarta EE 10 with MicroProfile 6.1.

```
<features>
   <feature>mpTelemetry-1.1</feature>
</features>
```

Additionally, third-party APIs must be made visible for your application in the server.xml:
```
<webApplication location="demo-microprofile-telemetry-inventory.war" contextRoot="/">
    <!-- enable visibility to third party apis -->
    <classloader apiTypeVisibility="+third-party"/>
</webApplication>
```

+

Since MP Rest Client 1.1 Applications can [register a `RestClientBuilderListener`][javadoc] by implementing the interface and creating a services file. Registered classes should be instantiated and called every time a new `RestClientBuilder` is created so that they can apply global configurations to all rest client instances.
+
However, the liberty `mpRestClient-1.x` and `mpRestClient-2.x` features do not call registered `RestClientBuilderListener`s for rest clients which are injected via CDI. This seems like a bug given that `RestClientBuilderListener` is, according to its docs, intended for global providers.

If that mechanism fails then the app server no longer updates its lease timestamp and other app servers in the recovery group will attempt peer recovery.  That peer recovery attempt will fail, because the logs heart beat timestamp will be current (that uses a different/the correct retry algoritm).

== New and updated guides since the previous release
As Open Liberty features and functionality continue to grow, we continue to add link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=new&key=tag[new guides to openliberty.io] on those topics to make their adoption as easy as possible.  Existing guides also receive updates to address any reported bugs/issues, keep their content current, and expand what their topic covers.

// // // // // // // //
// In the following section, list any new guides, or changes/updates to existing guides.  
// The following is an example of how the list can be structured (similar to the bugs section):
// * link:{url-prefix}/guides/[new/updated guide].html[Guide Title]
//  ** Description of the guide or the changes made to the guide.
