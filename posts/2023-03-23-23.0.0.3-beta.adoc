== Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6
This beta release also includes Jakarta EE Platform 10 and MicroProfile 6, which were first made available in the 22.0.0.13-beta. To find out more, reference the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/12/06/22.0.0.13-beta.html[22.0.0.13-beta blog post].


[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 20, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.


If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], you can install the All Beta Features package using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <configuration>
        <runtimeArtifact>
          <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
          <artifactId>openliberty-runtime</artifactId>
          <version>23.0.0.3-beta</version>
          <type>zip</type>
        </runtimeArtifact>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

You must also add dependencies to your pom.xml file for the beta version of the APIs that are associated with the beta features that you want to try.  For example, for Jakarta EE 10 and MicroProfile 6, you would include:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
    <version>6.0-RC3</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>10.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Or for link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '[23.0.0.3-beta,)'
}
----
