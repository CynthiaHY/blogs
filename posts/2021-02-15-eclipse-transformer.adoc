= Using the Eclipse Transformer for Jakarta EE 9 Development and Test
Thomas Bitonti <https://github.com/tbitonti>

== Overview

This article describes how application developers can use the Eclipse Transformer to update their application and test artifacts to run using Jakarta EE 9.

The core problem introduced by Jakarta EE 9 is the renaming of package prefixes from "javax" to "jakarta" for API packages and for properties.  As a consequence, existing applications which run against Java EE or Jakarta EE 8 do not run against Jakarta EE 9.  To run existing applications as Jakarta EE 9 applications, references to specific packages and properties must be updated.

To solve this problem, the Open Liberty development team created the Eclipse Transformer.  This open source project provides a utility which updates package references in a variety of artifacts.

The Open Liberty team uses the Eclipse Transformer on existing Java / Jakarta EE implementation archives.  The Open Liberty team also uses the transformer to update test artifacts, which include:

* Test applications;
* The actual tests;
* Server configuration files used by the tests;

In a similar fashion, application developers can use the Eclipse Transformer to transform their applications and test artifacts.

The transformer is quick and efficient.  When integrated as a build step, as is done in Open Liberty builds, use of the transformer avoids the creation of new Jakarta EE 9 source files.

== Transformation Strategy

The stratgy used for Jakarta EE 9 test enablement in Open Liberty builds is to annotate test classes and methods to indicate which of these are to be run as Jakarta EE 9 tests.  As an added step, the test framework transforms and re-runs the annotated tests as Jakarta EE 9 tests.

Two specific updates are required when transforming test artifacts.  First, package references are updated, changing Java / Jakarta EE "javax" package references into Jakarta EE 9 "jakarta" package references.  Package references can be in several locations, including test applications, test code, and server configurations.  Second, server configurations are updated to replace Java / Jakarta EE features with corresponding Jakarta EE 9 features.  The Eclipse Transformer is used to perform the first of these updates.  Currently, updates to server configurations must be done manually.  (Server configuration features could be updated using the transformer, if rules data were created with the substitution values needed for this update.)

== Invoking the Transformer

The Eclipse Transformer can be used directly from the command line, as a build task, or from Java code.  This article describes using the transformer from the command line.

(See the transformer project pages for detailed usage guidelines link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.transformer[Eclipse Transformer].)

=== Downloading the Transformer 

Several downloads are available from the project pages link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.transformer/downloads[Downloads].

Current snapshots are available at link:https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/eclipse/transformer/org.eclipse.transformer.cli/[Snapshots].

=== Building the transformer

Alternatively, the transformer can be built by cloning the link:https://github.com/eclipse/transformer[Eclipse Transformer repository] and invoking maven to build the transformer jar:

[source]
--
    maven clean package
--

=== Preparing a work area

Download or copy the transformer binaries to a local directory:

[source]
--
    mkdir <work>
    cd <work>
    cp transformer/org.eclipse.transformer.cli/target/org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.jar .
    unzip org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.jar
--

Unpackaging the distribution obtains:

[source]
--
    org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    libs/org.eclipse.transformer-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    libs/biz.aQute.bnd.transform-5.2.0.jar
    libs/slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar
    libs/commons-cli-1.4.jar
    libs/slf4j-simple-1.7.30.jar
--

=== Running the transformer with default rules

The transformer may now be run using the default rules:

[source]
--
  java -jar org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    <target_location> \
    <output_location>
--

(The jar 'org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar' is runnable, with the invocation selecting as main class 'org.eclipse.transformer.jakarta.JakartaTransformer' and with the necessary jars from the 'libs' folder included in the class path.)

The transformer can be run using custom rules by specifying additional arguments on the command line.  The additional arguments specify local rules files that the transformer is to be used instead of the default rules files.

For example, Open Liberty has more up-to-date rules for performing transformations.  To use the Open Liberty rules, download these from the Open Liberty GIT repository: link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/tree/integration/dev/wlp-jakartaee-transform/rules[Open Liberty Rules].

Add three command line arguments to the transformer command line invocation to pull in the more up-to-date rules data:

[source]
--
  java -jar org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    <target_location> \
    <output_location> \
    -tr ${rules}/jakarta-renames.properties \
    -td ${rules}/jakarta-direct.properties \
    -tf ${rules}/jakarta-xml-master.properties
--

(Usually, just these three additional command line arguments are needed.  Other command line arguments for transforming bundle archives, and for more finely selecting which target files are to be transformed.  Those other arguments do not usually need to be used.)

The target location can be a packaged application archive (EAR, WAR, RAR, or JAR file) or can be a directory containing the fully or partially expanded contents of one of these archives.  The target can also be a directory containing Java source, or a directory containing several application archives.  All of the artifacts in the target location are processed by the transformer.

=== More about transforming server configurations

Transformation of a server configuration is only necessary when "javax" prefixed package names are exposed in the server configuration.  One case is JMS activation specification elements.  For example:

[source]
--
  <jmsActivationSpec id="SharedSubscriptionWithMsgSel/TestTopic1">
    <properties.wasJms
        destinationRef="jms/FAT_TOPIC"
        destinationType="javax.jms.Topic"
        subscriptionDurability="DurableShared"
        clientId="cid1"
        subscriptionName="DURSUB"/>
  </jmsActivationSpec>
--

This must be transformed to:

[source]
--
  <jmsActivationSpec id="SharedSubscriptionWithMsgSel/TestTopic1">
    <properties.wasJms
        destinationRef="jms/FAT_TOPIC"
        destinationType="jakarta.jms.Topic"
        subscriptionDurability="DurableShared"
        clientId="cid1"
        subscriptionName="DURSUB"/>
  </jmsActivationSpec>
--

== Updating features in server configurations:

When running a Jakarta EE 9 enabled application using Open Liberty, Jakarta EE 9 features must be specified in the server configuration.  In many cases, Jakarta EE 9 features use the same short names as the corresponding Java / Jakarta EE features.  The Jakarta EE 9 features simply update the feature version.  In other cases, both the feature short name and the feature version must be updated.

Here is a table of features which use the same short names and for which only the feature version is updated:

.Java / Jakarta EE to Jakarta EE 9 Feature Updates: Version Only
|===
| Java / Jakarta EE feature name | Jakarta EE 9 feature name

| appClientSupport-1.0
| appClientSupport-2.0

| appSecurity-3.0
| appSecurity-4.0

| batch-1.0
| batch-2.0

| beanValidation-2.0
| beanValidation-3.0

| cdi-2.0
| cdi-3.0

| concurrent-1.0
| concurrent-2.0

| jsonb-1.0
| jsonb-2.0

| jsonbContainer-1.0
| jsonbContainer-2.0

| jsonp-1.1
| jsonp-2.0

| jsonpContainer-1.1
| jsonpContainer-2.0

| managedBeans-1.0
| managedBeans-2.0

| mdb-3.2
| mdb-4.0

| servlet-4.0
| servlet-5.0

| webProfile-8.0
| webProfile-9.0

| websocket-1.1
| websocket-2.0
|===

Here is a table of features which update both the feature short name and the feature version.

For these cases, if the incorrect Java EE feature short name is used with a new Jakarta EE 9 version, for example, changing "ejb-3.2" to "ejb-4.0", the server will not start, and the server will provide information to say that an updated feature name must be used.

.Java / Jakarta EE to Jakarta EE 9 Feature Updates: Short Name and Version

| javaee-8.0
| jakartaee-9.0
