Open Liberty 21.0.0.10-beta provides long-awaited Java 17 beta support, offering a lot of new enhancements and functionality. Also included are updates to MicroProfile Context Propagation, meaning that you can now use MicroProfile Context Propagation within your Jakarta EE 9 applications. This beta also offers JWE token format support for OpenID Connect Client and Social Media Login, as well as Jakarta EE 9 support for the remaining Open Liberty value-add features.

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.
[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features:

* <<java17, Java 17 Beta Support>>
* <<mp_cp, MicroProfile Context Propagation 1.3>>
* <<value_add, Jakarta EE 9 support for the remaining Open Liberty value-add features>>
* <<jwe, JWE support for OpenID Connect Client and Social Media Login>>

[#java17]
=== Java 17 Beta Support

The long awaited release of Java 17 is coming soon and it will be the first LTS (long term support) release since Java 11. It will offer a lot of new functionality and environmental changes that you will want to check into. Because it will be a milestone release, we thought you might like to take a test drive with the early access release of Java 17 (we have been testing with build 35). This will allow you to test out your existing applications and microservices or write a new one on your favorite server runtime, Open Liberty!

Some of the noteworthy highlights from Java 12-17:

[#mp_cp]
=== MicroProfile Context Propagation 1.3

MicroProfile Context Propagation 1.3 Release Candidate 1 adds support for Jakarta EE 9 packages (`jakarta.*`) and eventual alignment with the MicroProfile 5.0 platform.
With the 1.3 RC1 release, you can now use MicroProfile Context Propagation within your Jakarta EE 9 applications.

To enable the new beta features in your app, add them to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>cdi-3.0</feature>
    <feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
    <feature>mpContextPropagation-1.3</feature>  
    <feature>servlet-5.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
</server>
----

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], here are the coordinates:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.context-propagation</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-context-propagation-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.3-RC1</version>
</dependency>
----

For more information on this MicroProfile Context Propagation update, refer to the link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-context-propagation-1.3-RC1/apidocs/[JavaDoc] and link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-context-propagation-1.3-RC1/microprofile-context-propagation-spec-1.3-RC1.html[specification].

[#value_add]
=== Jakarta EE 9 support for the remaining Open Liberty value-add features

In Open Liberty 21.0.0.10-beta we now have Jakarta EE 9 support for the following value-add features:

* Admin Center (adminCenter-1.0)
* Batch Management (batchManagement-1.0)
* gRPC (grpc-1.0)
* gRPC Client (grpcClient-1.0)
* Web Response Cache (webCache-1.0)
* Web Services Atomic Transaction (wsAtomicTransaction-1.2)
* Web Services Security (wsSecurity-1.1)
* Web Services Security SAML (wsSecuritySaml-1.1)

Existing server configurations that use these value-add features will now work with Jakarta EE 9 features when migrating applications in those server configuration to use Jakarta EE9 technologies.

[#jwe]
=== JWE support for OpenID Connect Client and Social Media Login

With this beta, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 and Social Media Login 1.0 features support receiving tokens in the `JSON` Web Encryption (`JWE`) format. A `JWE` is a way to represent encrypted content using `JSON`. In addition to supporting `JWE`, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 feature provides an option to temporarily cache access token validation results for inbound propagation. Both features add support for the `RS384`, `RS512`, `HS384`, `HS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, and `ES512` signature algorithms.

Prior to this beta, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 and Social Media Login 1.0 features did not support consuming access or ID tokens in `JWE` format. This limited our interoperability with other `OIDC` clients and providers that use `JWEs` to propagate access tokens or provide identifying information about the authenticated user. With this beta, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 and Social Media Login 1.0 features will be able to interoperate with OpenID Connect Providers that provide `JWE` formatted access and ID tokens.

You can configure a Liberty OpenID Connect Relying Party to process access and ID tokens that are in a `JWE` format. The corresponding OpenID Connect Provider should support creating JWE access or ID tokens.

* Set the OpenID Connect Provider with the OpenID Connect Relying Party's public key that is used to encrypt the Content Encryption Key according to the OpenID Connect Provider's documentation.
* Set the `keyManagementKeyAlias` attribute to the private key alias of the key management key that is used to decrypt the Content Encryption Key of `JWE` token. The key must exist in the `keyStore` configured for the SSL configuration referred by the the `sslRef` attribute. For example, `<openidConnectClient keyManagementKeyAlias="privateKeyAlias" />`

Optional: Configure access token cache.

You can configure a Liberty OpenID Connect Relying Party to cache access token validation results for inbound propagation.

* Set the `accessTokenCacheEnabled` attribute to `true`.
* Set the `accessTokenCacheTimeout` attribute to a duration specifying how long an authenticated subject that is created by using a propagated access token is cached.
* Set the `tokenReuse` attribute to `true` if the OpenID Connect Relying Party must cache results for a `JWT` access token that includes a `jti` claim.
Although enabling this support may result in a performance improvement, it is recommended that the value for the `accessTokenCacheTimeout` attribute is short to reduce the possibility of a stale result as compared to what a validation call to the OpenID Connect Provider would have produced.

You can also configure Liberty OIDC Social Login to process ID tokens that are in a `JWE` format. The corresponding OpenID Connect Provider should support creating `JWE` ID tokens.

* Set the OpenID Connect Provider with the `OIDC` Social Login's public key that is used to encrypt the Content Encryption Key according to the OpenID Connect Provider's documentation.
* Set the `keyManagementKeyAlias` attribute to the private key alias of the key management key that is used to decrypt the Content Encryption Key of `JWE` token. The key must exist in the `keyStore` configured for the SSL configuration referred by the the `sslRef` attribute. For example, `<oidcLogin keyManagementKeyAlias="privateKeyAlias" />`

The signatureAlgorithm attributes of both elements now support the `RS384`, `RS512`, `HS384`, `HS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, and `ES512` signature algorithms.

`<openidConnectClient signatureAlgorithm="RS384"/>`
`<oidcLogin signatureAlgorithm="RS384"/>`
