This early release supports editing Liberty server.xml configuration, developing MicroProfile applications, a Liberty Dashboard for organizing your projects, and Liberty dev mode functions all from within your IDE.

== Liberty Dashboard

The Liberty Dashboard keeps all of your Maven and Gradle projects organized and is automatically populated with projects that are configured to run with Open Liberty. With a few clicks, you can start and stop your app, run tests and view test reports. 

== Dev Mode

Liberty Dev mode automatically picks up your code changes and deploys them to your running app all without having to restart the server. With Liberty Tools, your app starts in dev mode automatically giving you all of the benefits of faster development. 

== MicroProfile and Liberty config support

Configuring your Liberty server is now simpler than ever with server config auto-complete, validation, and "hover over" descriptions.

Additionally, you can quickly develop MicroProfile applications with automatic code blocks, auto-complete, and real time MP syntax validation. 


== Try it out

=== Installation

Install the plugin using the instructions found link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-tools-eclipse/blob/main/docs/installation/installation.md[here]

=== Using the Dashboard

Once installed, you will see the Open Liberty UFO logo in the top tray. Click on that to open the Liberty Dashboard tab:

The Dashboard will automatically populate with any Maven and Gradle projects in your workspace that are configured to run with Open Liberty (server.xml in the default location). If you do not have any apps in your current workspace, try importing one like the Open Liberty "Getting Started" app link:https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started[here]. Once imported, refresh the Dashboard tab by clicking the refresh icon in the top right.

You should see your app listed in the dashboard. Right-click on the app and you will see a dropdown with a list of actions.
