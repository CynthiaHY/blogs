   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.

This feature adopts OpenTelemetry from CNCF to allow MicroProfile Applications to benefit from OpenTelemetry and enable automatic tracing of Jakarta RESTful Web Services if configured.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

```xml
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpTelemetry-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
```

You can view the telemetry data from your application in Jaeger(https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.37/monitoring/#traces)  and Zipkin (https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html). To export your traces to one of these exporters, configure the exporter with system properties, e.g. `-Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger` or environment variables, e.g. `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=jaeger`.  You can also configure the exporter endpoints using `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT`.  To specify the name of the service, use `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

[#SUB_TAG_4]
== Distributed Security Caches

   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
   
 > Distributed security cache support has been introduced so that multiple Liberty servers can share caches via a JCache provider.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> Prior to this feature, the authentication (subject) and logged out cookie caches were restricted to be local and in-memory. Multiple servers were unable to benefit from their peers' caches and each server started with a cold cache.
>
> As part of this feature both caches can now both be stored in a distributed JCache. This can improve performance and failure recovery, reduce the load on backend user registries and improve the security posture of the server.
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

> NOTE: When using the new distribute caching functionality in this beta release, the feature `distributedSecurityCache-1.0` needs to be included in the list of features in the server.xml file. This beta-only feature that is used to expose the JCache APIs to the 3rd party JCache provider. When the distributed caching functionality is GA'd, this feature will no longer be available.

```
========================================================================
Configuring a Distributed Authentication Cache
========================================================================
```

> Because the creation of a subject might affect performance, Liberty provides an authentication cache to store a subject after an authentication of a user is successful. The authentication cache now can be distributed using a 3rd party JCache provider. To configure the distributed authentication cache, use the following server.xml configuration:

```
    <featureManager>
        <feature>appSecurity-3.0</feature>
        <feature>distributedSecurityCache-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>

    <!-- 
        The 3rd-party JCache provider library that Liberty will use to manage and connect to the cache.
     -->
    <library id="JCacheProviderLib">
        <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}" includes="jcacheprovider.jar" />
    </library>

    <!-- 
        Configure the JCache cache instance.
     -->
    <cache id="AuthCache" name="AuthCache">
        <cacheManager uri="uri://someuri">
            <properties prop1="value1" prop2="value2" />

            <cachingProvider libraryRef="JCacheProviderLib" />
        </cacheManager>
    </cache>

    <!-- 
        Configure the authentication cache.
     -->
    <authCache cacheRef="AuthCache" />
```

> If your Liberty environment injects custom principals or credentials into your subject (for instance in a custom LoginModule or Trust Association Interceptor (TAI)), in order to store them in the distributed authentication cache, they will need to be Serializable. Additionally, it is important that the shared library that contains those classes is made available to the caching provider and any other configurations that need access to those classes. If the same shared library is not used for each, ClassCastExceptions could be encountered when working with the classes retrieved from the distributed cache.

    <featureManager>
        <feature>appSecurity-3.0</feature>
        <feature>distributedSecurityCache-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>

    <!-- 
        The 3rd-party JCache provider library that Liberty will use to manage and connect to the cache.
     -->
    <library id="JCacheProviderLib">
        <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}" includes="jcacheprovider.jar" />
    </library>

    <!-- 
        This shared library contains any custom credentials and/or principals that
        are stored in the subject.
     -->
    <library id="CustomLib">
        <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}" includes="customlibrary.jar" />
    </library>

    <!-- 
        Take notice that the 'libraryRef' attribute has both library references.
     -->
    <cache ... >
        <cacheManager ... >
            <cachingProvider libraryRef="JCacheProviderLib,CustomLib" />
        </cacheManager>
    </cache>

    <!--
        Some sample JAAS custom login module configuration. The custom login module
        in this example would inject custom credentials or principals into the subject.

        Note that the 'libraryRef' in the 'jaasLoginModule' needs to be set to the same
        library referenced from the caching provider.
     -->
    <jaasLoginContextEntry id="system.WEB_INBOUND"
        name="system.WEB_INBOUND"
        loginModuleRef="custom, hashtable, userNameAndPassword, certificate, token" />

    <jaasLoginModule id="custom"
        className="org.acme.CustomLoginModule"
        controlFlag="REQUIRED" libraryRef="CustomLib" />

    <!-- 
        Any applications that will be accessing classes from the Subject also need
        to use the same library reference.
     -->
    <application ...>
        <classloader commonLibraryRef="CustomLib" />
    </application>


>A few points to consider when configuring a JCache cache for use with the authentication cache.
>- the distributed authentication cache is comprised of keys and values of type Object
>- to match the behavior of the local authentication cache, set a least recently used eviction (LRU) policy with a maximum entry count of 25000 and an entry TTL of 600 seconds. Note that with distributed caches, partitioning of the cache can lead to an actual capacity below the configured value. 
>- if your JCache provider supports it, configure a client-side cache to reduce transactions to the distributed cache. If the client-side cache supports storing the entries as deserialized objects, this can further improve performance.
>- support in the beta is currently limited to LTPA and JWT. Single sign-on methods such as SPNEGO, Oauth, OIDC and SAML (etc) are not yet supported
>- Subjects in the distributed cache should be treated as you would treat other security-sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords. Configure your JCache provider to secure the data while it is in motion and at rest. This should include encryption and access control.

```
========================================================================
Configuring a Distributed Logged-Out Cookie Cache
========================================================================
```
> The logged-out cookie cache stores LTPA and JWT cookies that have been logged-out. The logged-out cookie cache can now be distributed using a 3rd party JCache provider ensuring that logged out cookies are enforced across multiple servers. To configure the distributed logged-out cookie cache, use the following server.xml configuration:

```
    <featureManager>
        <feature>appSecurity-3.0</feature>
        <feature>distributedSecurityCache-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>

    <!-- 
        The 3rd-party JCache provider library that Liberty will use to manage and connect to the cache.
     -->
    <library id="JCacheProviderLib">
        <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}" includes="jcacheprovider.jar" />
    </library>

    <!-- 
        Configure the JCache instances.
     -->
    <cache id="LoggedOutCookieCache" name="LoggedOutCookieCache">
        <cacheManager uri="uri://someuri">
            <properties prop1="value1" prop2="value2" />

            <cachingProvider libraryRef="JCacheProviderLib" />
        </cacheManager>
    </cache>

    <!-- 
        Configure the authentication cache to use the JCache. 
     -->
    <webAppSecurity loggedoutCookieCacheRef="LoggedOutCookieCache" />
```

>A few points to consider when configuring a JCache cache for use with the logged-out cookie cache.
>- the distributed logged-out cookie cache is comprised of keys and values of type Object
>- to match the behavior of the local logged-out cookie cache, configure the cache with a maximum entry count of 10000 and an entry TTL of unlimited. Note that with distributed caches, partitioning of the cache can lead to an actual capacity below the configured value. The cache capacity should be large enough that no cookies that have not expired will be evicted due to new logged out cookies being inserted into the cache.
>- if your JCache provider supports it, configure a client-side cache to reduce transactions to the distributed cache. If the client-side cache supports storing the entries as deserialized objects, this can further improve performance.

```
========================================================================
Configuring a Session Cache with the new Distributed Cache Configuration
========================================================================
```
> The sessionCache-1.0 feature has been updated to allow use of the new distributed cache configuration elements to allow common configuration across all features that use JCache. This eliminates the need to configure JCache separately for the session cache.

```
    <featureManager>
        <feature>distributedSecurityCache-1.0</feature>
        <feature>sessionCache-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>

    <!-- 
        The 3rd-party JCache provider library that Liberty will use to manage and connect to the cache.
     -->
    <library id="JCacheProviderLib">
        <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}" includes="jcacheprovider.jar" />
    </library>

    <!-- 
        Configure the JCache cache manager.
     -->
    <cacheManager id="CacheManager" uri="uri://someuri">
        <properties prop1="value1" prop2="value2" />

        <cachingProvider libraryRef="JCacheProviderLib" />
    </cacheManager>

    <!--
        Configure the HTTP session cache.
     -->
    <httpSessionCache cacheManagerRef="CacheManager" ... />
```

```
========================================================================
Configuring Multiple Caches
========================================================================
```
> When configuring multiple distributed caches, instead of nesting the cacheManager configuration element within the cache element, the cache element needs to refer to the cache manager via the cacheRef attribute.

```
    <featureManager>
        <feature>appSecurity-3.0</feature>
        <feature>distributedSecurityCache-1.0</feature>
        <feature>sessionCache-1.0</feature>
