The `adminCenter-1.0` feature enables the Liberty Administrative Center (“Admin Center”), a web-based graphical interface for deploying, monitoring and managing Liberty servers in standalone and collective environments. In this post, we’ll take a look how you can use the feature in Open Liberty.

[#TAG_1]
== Set up Admin Center

[start=1]
. If you link:https://openliberty.io/downloads/[download] the *All GA Features* zip then skip this step, otherwise install the `adminCenter-1.0` feature using the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/21.0.0.3/reference/command/featureUtility-installFeature.html[featureUtility].
For example, in a command window at the wlp/bin directory:
+
[source]
----
featureUtility installFeature adminCenter-1.0
----
+
[start=2]
. If your Liberty installation does not have a server, create a Liberty server.
For example, in a command window at the wlp/bin directory, create a server named myServer.
+
[source]
----
server create myServer
----
+
[start=3]
. Configure the `server.xml` file to enable Admin Center and secure login.
+
[loweralpha, start=a]
.. To enable the Admin Center feature, add the feature to the `server.xml`:
+
[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>adminCenter-1.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----
+
[start=b]
.. Add one or more users to configure a secure login.
+
[source, xml]
----
<basicRegistry realm="basicRealm">
   <user name="admin" password="adminpwd" />
   <user name="reader" password="readerpwd" />
</basicRegistry>
----
+
[start=c]
.. Configure administrative roles required to access the Admin Center.
+
  * A user with the administrator-role has full access to the Admin Center.
+
[source, xml]
----
<administrator-role>
   <user>admin</user>
</administrator-role>
----
+
  * A user with the reader-role has read-only access to the Admin Center.
+
[source, xml]
----
<reader-role>
   <user>reader</user>
</reader-role>
----
+
[start=d]
.. To protect keystore files that have server authentication credentials, define a keystore and assign it a password.
+
[source, xml]
----
<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="Liberty" />
----
+
[start=e]
.. To access Admin Center from a smartphone, tablet, or remote computer, ensure that the `server.xml` file sets the host attribute of the httpEndpoint element to * (asterisk) or to a defined host name. By default, the host attribute is set to localhost.
+
[source, xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
              host="*"
              httpPort="9080"
              httpsPort="9443" />
----
+
[start=f]
.. Save your changes to the `server.xml` file.
+
[start=4]
. If the server is not running, start the server.
For example, in a command window at the wlp/bin directory, enter a run or start command.
+
[source]
----
server run myServer
----
+
Look for server messages that show the adminCenter web application is running. After Admin Center is running, you can point a web browser at the application and log in.

[#TAG_2]
== Log in to Admin Center

. Point a web browser at Admin Center  https://host_name:port_number/adminCenter/

.. For host_name, specify the IP address or domain name server (DNS) hostname of the computer on which the Liberty server is running. Specify localhost only if the browser is running on the same computer as the server.

.. For port_number, specify the httpsPort value in the server.xml file, as shown in the following example:
+
https://localhost:9443/adminCenter/
+
https://myhost.xyz.com:9443/adminCenter/
+  
https://9.65.234.567:9443/adminCenter/

. If your browser prompts you to confirm that the connection is trusted, specify an exception or otherwise enable the connection to continue to Admin Center.

. Log in to Admin Center.
When you configured the `server.xml` file of the server to enable Admin Center, you defined one or more usernames and passwords that are authorized to access the Admin Center. To log in to Admin Center, specify an authorized username and password.
+
For example, specify the username admin and the password adminpwd.

[#TAG_3]
== The Toolbox

When you log in to Admin Center, you view the `Toolbox`, which contains tools such as the `Server Config` and `Explore` and a bookmark to link:https://openliberty.io[openliberty.io].

image::img/blog/ui_toolbox.png[align="center"]

To add or remove tools and bookmarks, select *Edit* image:img/blog/ui_edit.png[] and use the `Tool Catalog` to customize your user-specific `Toolbox`.

To view a tool, select its `Toolbox` icon or directly start the tool by using the URL that is shown in the browser when you view the tool. For example, to directly start the `Explore` tool, use a URL such as https://localhost:9443/adminCenter/#explore.

Later, to log out of Admin Center, select *User* image:img/blog/ui_user.png[User] *> Log out* user_name.

[#TAG_4]
== The Server Config tool

You can use the Server Config tool to view and edit server configuration files in the Liberty topology. The Server Config tool displays configuration files such as a `server.xml` file in two modes. The Design mode displays the content of configuration files using graphical controls with inline documentation. The Source mode provides direct access to the file text and has content assist capabilities. You can customize the modes, for example, to add or remove parameter descriptions on the Design mode or to add or remove line numbers on the Source mode. Before you can edit files, you must add a link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/remoteFileAccess.html[remoteFileAccess] element to the server configuration file; otherwise, files are shown in read-only mode.

Click on `server.xml` displays the content of the configuration file:

[#TAG_5]
== The Explore tool

You can use the Explore tool to work with application, server, cluster, host, and runtime resources. Admin Center on a stand-alone server offers options to view information about the stand-alone server and its applications, to stop, start or restart resources, and to search for resources.

image::img/blog/ui_exploreTool.png[align="center"]

[#TAG_6]
== The Java Batch tool

If you configured link:https://openliberty.io/docs/21.0.0.3/reference/feature/batchManagement-1.0.html[batchManagement-1.0] feature, you can access the Admin Center `Java Batch` tool. With the `Java Batch` tool you can view the progress and status of your Java™ batch jobs, manage their instances, and view their log files.

image::img/blog/ui_javaBatchTool.png[align="center"]

If the batch jobs or job logs do not reside on the server that runs Admin Center, configure link:https://openliberty.io/docs/21.0.0.3/reference/config/cors.html[CORS] on each remote server that has batch jobs or job logs to enable Admin Center to request job information from each remote server.

[#TAG_7]
== The OIDC tool

TBD

== Thank you for checking it out!
